description
this
research
covers
two
closely
related
areas
of
collaboration
technology
collaborative
tools
and
infrastructures
in
the
area
of
collaborative
tools
it
is
addressing
the
potential
of
these
tools
for
making
distributed
collaborative
software
engineering
tasks
more
concurrent
thereby
allowing
these
time
consuming
tasks
to
be
completed
significantly
more
quickly
in
the
area
of
collaborative
infrastructures
it
is
addressing
support
for
near
automatic
generation
of
efficient
collaborative
tools
thereby
significantly
reducing
the
tremendous
amount
of
effort
required
to
program
these
tools
manually
these
two
efforts
are
related
since
the
infrastructure
is
being
used
to
build
the
tools
and
the
tools
are
being
used
to
evaluate
the
infrastructure
some
of
the
specific
issues
being
addressed
include
security
consistency
undo
computer
support
for
gathering
software
engineering
requirements
and
asynchronous
software
engineering
meetings
the
research
is
using
an
experimental
method
wherein
the
infrastructure
and
tools
are
being
implemented
and
used
in
case
studies
the
research
results
include
taxonomies
of
collaboration
scenarios
principles
interaction
models
software
abstractions
and
architectures
that
support
these
scenarios
and
evaluation
of
the
infrastructure
and
tools
being
developed
