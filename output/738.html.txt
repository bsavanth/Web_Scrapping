our
research
group
is
focusing
on
a
number
of
fundamental
issues
related
to
the
design
of
novel
algorithms
protocols
and
architectures
that
enable
efficient
fault
tolerant
parallel
and
distributed
computing
for
scientific
and
commercial
applications
this
research
program
is
a
blend
of
basic
research
and
experimental
systems
activities
creating
a
balance
between
theory
and
practice
the
experimental
activities
are
centered
in
the
laboratory
for
fault
tolerant
parallel
and
distributed
computing
which
includes
a
cluster
of
powerful
workstations
all
connected
via
communication
hubs
consisting
of
high
speed
interconnects
the
scope
of
the
program
consists
of
the
following
highly
interrelated
topics
efficient
parallel
computing
over
distributed
environments
fault
tolerant
parallel
distributed
computing
novel
models
for
computing
inspired
by
neural
networks
projects
rain
reliable
array
of
independent
nodes
