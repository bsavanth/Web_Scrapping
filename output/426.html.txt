lisp
information
since
lisp
is
used
in
a
lot
not
all
of
ai
programming
the
course
will
begin
with
a
discussion
of
common
lisp
it
would
probably
be
useful
to
have
some
lisp
reference
available
to
supplement
the
lectures
and
the
on

help
available
within
lisp
itself
there
are
many
paperbacks
available
most
of
which
are
probably
