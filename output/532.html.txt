enrollment
policy
csc
517
is
always
one
of
the
most
popular
courses
in
the
graduate
program
because
it
is
a
video
course
it
needs
to
meet
in
one
of
the
college
of
engineering
studios
the
largest
studio
holds
60
students
therefore
we
can
accommodate
only
60
on
campus
students
since
several
students
drop
the
course
during
the
semester
we
have
increased
the
enrollment
limit
for
csc
517
to
80
this
means
that
not
all
students
will
fit
in
the
studio
consequently
lectures
during
the
first
month
of
the
course
will
also
be
shown
in
an
oveflow
room
which
unfortunately
does
not
have
a
two
way
audio
video
link
with
the
studio
thus
students
watching
from
that
room
will
not
be
able
to
ask
questions
seats
in
the
studio
will
be
allocated
on
an
fcfs
basis
students
may
also
watch
the
lectures
via
videotape
in
the
media
center
of
the
d
h
hill
library
between
the
hours
of
8
am
10
pm
m
f
and
1
pm
10
pm
on
sunday
after
the
first
month
attendance
at
lectures
typically
drops
enough
so
that
the
overflow
room
is
no
longer
necessary
all
remaining
students
will
be
able
to
watch
all
lectures
live
if
the
course
fills
despite
the
increase
in
the
enrollment
limit
we
regret
that
we
will
not
have
the
resources
in
classrooms
or
ta
support
to
accommodate
all
the
students
