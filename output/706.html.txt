high
performance
synchronization
is
becoming
increasingly
important
several
groups
including
ours
have
demonstrated
in
recent
years
that
software
synchronization
algorithms
can
scale
well
to
very
large
numbers
of
processors
and
that
they
can
avoid
certain
negative
interactions
with
high
performance
scheduling
algorithms
we
are
continuing
this
research
in
several
directions
including
1
mechanisms
for
cooperative
synchronization
and
scheduling
which
minimize
unnecessary
spinning
maximize
processor
locality
and
avoid
contention
for
both
lock
and
non
lock
data

comparative
evaluation
of
alternative
mechanisms
for
atomic
update
of
shared

structures
including
locks
non
blocking
synchronization
and
function

implementation
of
