research
goals
the
proteus
project
is
a
project
of
research
and
development
in
natural
language
processing
conducted
in
the
department
of
computer
science
new
york
university
under
the
direction
of
prof
ralph
grishman
the
basic
research
is
focussed
on
the
automated
acquisition
of
linguistic
knowledge
from
large
corpora
we
are
developing
methods
for
the
acquisition
of
probabilistic
grammars
semantic
relations
between
words
and
selectional
patterns
this
research
is
tied
to
applications
in
four
areas
information
retrieval
the
retrieval
of
documents
from
large
collections
