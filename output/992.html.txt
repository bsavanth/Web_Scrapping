motivation
parallel
and
distributed
machines
have
become
the
premiere
computational
engines
for
both
business
and
research
endeavors
and
their
use
is
permeating
into
many
other
disciplines
in
addition
new
ways
of
interacting
with
computers
have
evolved
enabling
higher
levels
of
interaction
among
end
users
as
well
as
enhanced
interactivity
between
end
users
and
their
programs
than
previously
possible
as
a
result
of
these
developments
large
scale
applications
routinely
use
multiple
distributed
and
prallel
machines
connected
by
high
performance
communcation
media
the
architectural
environment
for
facilitating
the
construction
and
use
of
interactive
distributed
and
parallel
applications
is

machines

mulitcomputers
comprised
of
a
farm
of
high
peformance
workstations
all
of
which
are
interconnected
via
high
speed
networks
while
such
hardware
and
some
of
the
software
components
are
readily
available
what
is
lacking
is
the
technology
for
easily
assembling
them
to
form
complete
applications
that
are
efficient
flexible
and
highly
usable
for
non
computer
scientists
the
development
of
such
technology
is
a
fundamental
challenge
for
systems
researchers
the
systems
group
in
the
college
of
computing
addresses
this
challenge
in
an
application
conscious
way
the
research
projects
currently
being
investigated
cross
the
boundaries
of
architecture
operating
systems
compilers
and
programming
languages
