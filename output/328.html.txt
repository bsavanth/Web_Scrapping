construction
abstract
an
ontological
mediator
is
an
intelligent
agent
capable
of
facilitating
communication
between
other
agents
who
use
the
same
communication
protocols
but
use
their
common
language
in
different
ways
different
knowlege
agents
employ
different
ontologies
or
ways
of
taxonomizing
and
constraining
their
domains
when
two
agents
are
using
different
ontologies
communication
cannot
occur
unless
the
agents
can
agree
on
the
meaning
of
words
and
phrases
often
they
cannot
or
they
do
not
have
the
capability
to
hold
such
a
conversation
a
mediator
is
actively
involved
in
understanding
the
content
of
the
messages
sent
between
communicating
agents
and
will
use
knowledge
in
its
domain
of
mediation
to
determine
where
conflicts
arise
learn
the
meanings
of
new
words
translate
expressions
appropriately
and
expand
the
ontologies
of
both
communicating
agents
our
research
project
is
exploring
various
issues
in
ontologies
knowledge
sharing
vocabulary
acquisition
and
distributed

we
are
building
