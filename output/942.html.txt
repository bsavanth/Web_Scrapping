description
the
focus
of
the
research
on
software
measurement
has
been
on
identifying
and
measuring
non
trivial
characteristics
related
to
software
quality
much
of
this
work
has
focused
on
measuring
cohesion
in
the
procedural
paradigm
recently
we
have
shifted
our
focus
to
include
the
object
oriented
paradigm
