course
overview
this
is
one
of
a
string
of
advanced
courses
research
seminars
held
in
recent
years
that
attempts
to
forge
strong
links
between
parallel
and
distributed
computing
and
between
formalism
and
system
design
as
an
experiment
we
will
run
the
course
along
two
tracks
each
track
will
have
a
concrete
goal
for
the
class
participants
to
reach
as
a
group
that
of
writing
a
single
collective
report
on
a
major
topic
of
current
research
interest
or
that
of
implementing
a
small
software
tool
the
best
contributions
will
be
selected
to
form
the
basis
of
one
or
two
publishable
survey
papers
original
research
contributions
or
professional
magazine
articles
as
the
case
may
be
track
1
design
problems
develop
notation
and
formalism
to
speak
and
reason
precisely
about
various
desirable
properties
of
distributed
systems
of
which
there
are
multiple
classes
safety
including
serializability
coherence
consistency
atomicity
etc
liveness
fairness
and
stability
including
self
stabilization
reliability
availability
fault
tolerance
performability
and
dependability
scalability
throughput
response
time
timeliness
efficiency
utilization
load
balance
and
cost
effectiveness
security
privacy
trustworthiness
and
authentication
autonomy
and
responsiveness
usability
convenience
and
human
complexity
the
idea
is
to
try
to
reach
a
wide
and
deep
understanding
of
the
design
problem
of
a
distributed
system
only
a
subset
of
these
properties
need
be
covered
in
the
group
report
and
one
of
our
early
tasks
will
be
to
select
this
subset
based
on
research
value
and
interest
of
the
participants
track
2
systems
and
tool
survey
in
more
breadth
than
depth
the
most
important
papers
tools
and
systems
relating
to
file
systems
multimedia
web
internet
atm
scheduling
corba
java
parallel
programming
environments
etc
format
the
weekly
two
hour
class
meeting
will
generally
consist
of
two
components
each
furthering
progress
along
one
of
the
two
tracks
mentioned
above
the
first
half
of
the
course
will
consist
of
presentations
by
the
instructor
the
second
half
by
students
these
presentations
will
generally
follow
the
same
format
described
below
the
intent
of
this
half
is
to
bring
the
background
of
the
whole
class
up
to
a
point
where
a
shared
language
is
possible
in
which
research
problems
can
be
efficiently
discussed
an
equally
important
goal
is
to
try
to
set
forth
a
research
agenda
over
which
we
can
focus
our
collective
effort
there
will
be
homeworks
during
this
part
of
the
course
each
participant
will
give
two
1
hour
presentations
along
each
of
the
two
tracks
one
about
existing
work
and
another
about
project
work
done
for
the
course
by
week
five
of
semester

a
date
for
two
presentations
one
for

1
and
another

are
stiff
low
friction
and
backdrivable
this
in
turn
permits
a
lightweight
design
to
achieve
good
bandwidth
in
force
control
while
in
contact
with
the
environment
the
arm
s
design
maximizes
the
lowest
resonant
frequency
of
the
system
and
employs
an
impedance
matching
ratio
between
motor
and
arm
masses
this
also
enables
the
arm
to
achieve
high
accelerations
while
moving
in
free
space
prof
slotine
and
his
students
have
developed
system
architectures
and
control
algorithms
for
both
force
controlled
tasks
and
tasks
requiring
rapid
and
accurate
free
space
motion
the
algorithms
also
provide
fast
and
stable
adaptation
of
the
arm
to
large
variations
in
loads
and
environments
the
talon
a
new
wrist
hand
mechanism
has
been
developed
and
replaces
a
previous
forearm
mounted
system
the
new
wrist
hand
known
as
the
talon
provides
3
additional
powered
freedoms
one
for
grasping
forces
and
two
for
orientation
the
motors
for
the
device
are
located
in
the
forearm
to
minimize
end
effector
mass
and
maximize
its
workspace
the
grasping
mechanism
is
comprised
of
a
group
of
2
fingers
which
move
against
a
group
of
3
fingers
such
that
two
groups
may
be
made
to
mesh
together
while
encircling
objects
finger
inner
surfaces
are
serrated
to
provide
for
high
contact
friction
against
rough
rock
surfaces
and
curved
to
enhance
capturing
large
and
small
objects
fingers
may
deflect
compliantly
to
accomodate
to
object
geometry
and
finger
deflections
may
be
sensed
to
provide
for
monitoring
grasp
state
we
also
have
studied
the
design
of
a
miniature
end
effector
suitable
for
grasping
small
rocks
and
cylindrical
objects
similar
in
spirit
to
the
talon
the
new
miniature
end
effector
utilizes
slightly
different
kinematics
to
enlarge
its
feasible
grasping
volume
the
fast
eye
gimbals
a
more
recent
component
of
our
system
is
our
active
vision
system
which
is
comprised
of
two
hi
resolution
color
ccd
cameras
with
50
mm
focal
length
lenses
mounted
on
two
degree
of
freedom
gimbals
we
have
utilized
cameras
with
a
narrow
field
of
view
to
give
higher
resolution
images
of
typical
objects
this
implies
however
that
the
cameras
have
to
be
actuated
in
order
to
pan
and
tilt
so
that
they
can
cover
broad
scenes
leading
to
an
active
vision
system
and
an
associated
trade
off
between
controller
precision
and
image
resolution
narrowness
of
field
of
view
the
actuators
which
we
have
implemented
were
designed
in
our
lab
and
are
known
as
the
fast
eye
gimbals
fegs
the
fegs
provide
directional
positioning
for
our
cameras
using
a
similar
drive
mechanism
as
the
wam
the
two
joints
are
cable
driven
and
have
ranges
of
motion
of
90
degrees
and
45
degrees
in
the
base
and
upper
joint
axes
respectively
these
two
fegs
are
currently
strategically
mounted
on
ceiling
rafters
with
a
wide
baseline
for
higher
position
accuracy
using
stereo
vision
methods
the
independent
nature
of
the
fegs
allow
us
to
position
each
one
at
different
locations
in
order
to
vary
the
baseline
or
orientation
of
the
coordinate
frame
as
well
as
easily
add
additional
cameras
to
provide
additional
perspectives

one
of
our
current
projects
funded
by
nasa
jpl
is
to
develop
a
fundamental
understanding
of
the
problem
of
combining
real
time
vision
and
touch
sensor
data
with
robot
control
to
yield
robust
autonomous

the
research
is
focused
on
providing
conceptual
and
experimental
support
of
planned

we
have
implemented
a
high

another
direction
of
our
research
funded
by
fujitsu
furukawa
and
the
sloan
foundation
is
to
accomplish
real

robust
catching
of
free

objects
we
are
currently
focusing
on
spherical
balls
of
various
sizes
we
are
also
experimenting
with
additional
objects
with
different
dynamic
characteristics
such
as
sponge
balls
cylindrical
cans
and
paper
airplanes
our
system
uses
low
cost
vision
processing
hardware
for
simple
information
extraction
each
camera
signal
is
processed
independently
on
vision
boards
designed
by
other
members
of
the
mit

laboratory
the
cognachrome
vision

system
these
vision
boards
provide
us
with

number
of
pixels
and
aspect
ratio
of
the
color
keyed

the
two
fast
eye
gimbals
allow
us
to
locate
and
track
fast
randomly
moving
objects
using
kalman
like
filtering
methods
assuming
no
fixed
model
for
the
behavior
of
the
motion
independent
of
the
tracking
algorithms
we
use
least
squares
techniques
to
fit
polynomial
curves
to
prior
object
location
data
to
determine
the
future
path
with
this
knowledge
in
hand
we
can
calculate
a
path
for
the
wam
to
match
trajectories
with
the
object
to
accomplish
catching
and
smooth

wam
post
catching
deceleration
in
addition
to
the
basic
least

techniques
for
path
prediction
we
study
experimentally
nonlinear
estimation
algorithms
to
give
long
term
real
time
prediction
of
the
path
of
moving
objects
with
the
goal
of
robust
acquisition
the
algorithms
are
based
on
stable

construction
of
approximation
networks
composed
of
state
space
basis
functions
localized
in
both
space

as
a
initial
step
we
have
studied
the

performance
in
predicting
the

further
application
may
include
motion

what
is
rllc
rllc
is
involved
in
research
on
the
design
and
development
of
lexically
based
semantic
indexing
and
content
abstraction
techniques
for
documents
these
techniques
employ
robust
natural
language
processing
of
text
to
generate
multi
purpose
structures
which
we
call
lexical
webs
lexical
webs
are
normalized
structured
representations
of
the
semantic
content
of
a
text
or
group
of
texts
an
important
application
of
lexical
webs
is
their
potential
role
in
accelerating
the
placement
of
information
on
the
web
in
a
highly
indexed
format
which
facilitates
navigation
and
rapid

access
see

demo
this
work
emerges
directly
from
previous
research
carried
out
under
the
nsf
arpa
human
language
technologies
program
our
goal
in
this
research
has
been
the
development
of
an
intelligent
and
trainable
lexical
database
for
a
substantial
fragment
of
english
called
the
core
lexical
engine
central
to
this
work
is
an
integration
of
lexical
semantic
techniques
with
corpus
based
approaches
to
lexical
acquisition
by
characterizing
the
statistical
properties
of
texts
which
have
been
annotated
with
semantic
tags
one
can
infer
semantic
relations
in
unmarked
texts
that
are
richer
than
mere
collocational
associations
future
research
is
directed
towards
techniques
for
automatically
enriching
the
model
of
web
based
documents
by
making
use
of
and
extending
these
technologies
it
takes
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
generative
lexicon
framework
has
developed
partly
in
the
context
of
work
within
the
tipster
and
muc
efforts
namely
providing
statistically
sensitive
semantic
techniques

lexically

the
programming
systems
research
group
is
exploring
methodologies
to
facilitate
the
discovery
and
use
of
information
our
current
projects
include
an
intelligent
query
access
system
that
implements
resource
discovery
on
the
internet
nii
digital
video
storage
composition
and
presentation
mobile
access
to
internet
resources

these
projects
are
presently
based
on
extensions
to
semantic
file
systems
mosaic

each
of
our
projects
is
designed
to
test
a

concept
examples
of
concepts
we
are
currently
examining
include
content
routing
algebraic
video
and
the
creative
use
highly
asymmetic
bandwidth
our
approach
to
research
is
to
use
formal
tools
implementation
and
experimentation
to
help
us
understand
the
strenghts
and
limitations
of
a
given
system
the
end
goals
of
a
project
are
to
publish
new
algorithms
and
experimental
findings
to
create
a
complete
system
that
can
be
released
for
use
by

pattern
separation
via
mathematical

this
www
page
describes
work
in
pattern
separation
via
linear
programming
in
the
mathematical
programming
section
of
the
university
of
wisconsin
madison
computer
sciences
department
brief
history
and
method
outline
mathematical
optimization
approaches
in
particular
linear
programming
have
long
been
used
in
problems
of
pattern
separation
in
65
linear
programs
were
used
to
construct
planes
to
separate
linearly
separable
point
sets
separation
by
a
nonlinear
surface
using
linear
programming
was
also
described
whenever
the
surface
parameters
appeared
linearly
e
g
a
quadratic
or
polynomial
surface
these
formulations
however
could
fail
on
sets
that
were
not
separable
by
a
surface
linear
in
its
parameters
a
multisurface
method
msm

93
avoided
this
difficulty
msm
separates
2
disjoint
finite
point
sets
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
as
follows
choose
2
parallel
planes
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
as
close
together
so
that
only
the
region
between
the
two
planes
contains
points
from
both
sets
i
e
the
regions
not
between
the
2
parallel
planes
contain
only
points
of
1
set
or
no
points
discard
the
points
in
the
regions
not
between
the
2
parallel
planes
repeat
the
process
on
the
points
between
the
2
parallel
planes
until
the
region
between
the
2
parallel
planes
contains
no
points
or
very
few
points
multisurface
method
tree
msm
t
a
variant
on
the
multisurface
method
was
developed
in
92
a
92
b
93
let
a
and
b
be
finite
disjoint
point
sets
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
the
goal
of
msm
t
is
to
determine
a
sequence
of
planes
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
that
separate
the
sets
a
and
b
as
follows
determine
a
plane
in
n
dimensional
euclidean
space
that
minimizes
the
average
distances
of
misclassified
points
a
point
from
set
a
is
misclassified
if
it
lies
on
the
side
of
the
separating
plane
assigned
to
b
similarly
a
point
from
set
b
is
misclassified
if
it
lies
on
the
side
of
the
separating
plane
assigned
to
a
if
the
regions
assigned
to
a
and
b
contain
only
or
mostly
points
of
the
set
a
or
b
then
stop
otherwise
generate
another
error
minimizing
plane
in
1
in
this
region
the
sequence
of
planes
generated
can
be
viewed
as
a
decision
tree
for
each
node
in
the
tree
the
best
split
of
the
points
reaching
that
node
is
found
by
solving
the
lp
in
1
above
the
node
is
split
into
2
branches
and
the
same
procedure
is
applied
until
there
are
only
or
mostly
points
of
one
set
at
the
node
this
linear
programming
approach
can
also
be
viewed
as
training
a
neural
network
with
1
hidden
layer
see
93
msm
t
has
been
shown
to
learn
concepts
as
well
or
better
than
more
traditional
learning
methods
such
as
c4
5
and
cart
it
also
has
an
advantage
over
artificial
neural
network
ann
methods
such
as
backpropagation
in
that
training
proceeds
much
faster

this
information
will
not

it
will
be
your
responsibility
to
read
and
understand
it

so
that
if
it
gets
misplaced
it
can
be

course
description
and
procedures
computer
science
142
is
designed
for
students
who
intend
to
major
in
computer
science
or
in
areas
having
a
strong
emphasis
on
computer
programming
while
no
prior
knowledge
of
computers
is
required
the
course
is
a
challenging
one
and
demands
self
discipline
and
hard
work
of
each
student
although
computer
science
142
is
not
a
new
course
it
has
been
offered
for
many
years
the
content
has
undergone
extensive
revision
during
the
past
3
years
this
revision
is
in
response
to
a
new
approach
to
computer
programming
known
as
object
oriented
programming
object
oriented
programming
is
fast
becoming
the
accepted
methodology
for
the
design
and
development
of
today
s
large
and
complex
software
systems
and

which

we
have
written
our
own
text
quot
a
first
course
in
object
oriented
programming
quot
in
a
sense
our
new
approach
is
experimental
many
computer
science
teachers
are
skeptical
about
it
we
are
cautiously
optimistic
that
we
are
developing
an
approach
and
associated
materials
that
will
prove
to
be
effective
in
providing
a
foundation
for
object
oriented
program
design
and
development
throughout
the
computer
science
curriculum
we
are
sure
to
discover
things
we
will
want
to
change
as
we
gain
experience
with
our
new
approach
we
are
anxious
to
receive
constructive
feed
back
from
students
concerning
the
text
the
programming
assignments
the
examples
the
order
and
selection
of
topics
or
any
aspect
of
the
class
many
students
enrolling
in
this
course
have
done
a
little
or
a
lot
of
programming
in
pascal
or
some
other
programming
language
however
it
is
unlikely
that
many
students
have
had
experience
with
object
oriented
programming
if
you
have
had
little
or
no
experience
with
computers
and
programming
you
may
feel
yourself
at
a
disadvantage
compared
to
others
who
have
had
programming
experience
some
students
in
this
situation
do
well
and
experience
little
difficulty
while
others
experience
significant
difficulty
and
frustration
even
some
students
with
programming
experience
may
struggle
we
will
try
very
hard
to
pace
the
course
for
beginners
and
will
not
let
experienced
programmers
divert
our
lectures
or
discussions
toward
advanced
or
obscure
topics
if
you
are
having
trouble
understanding
the
lectures
the
reading
or
the
programming
assignments
then
seek
help
early
and
often
tas
in
the
lab
can
help
you
your
instructor
can
help
you
and
you
can
attend
a
help
section
help
sections
for

are
scheduled
each
semester
times
and
locations
are
posted
in
the

plan
to
attend
at
least
one
help
section
each

a
teaching
assistant
who
knows
pascal
well
will
help
with
design
and
development
of
the
coming
assignment
and
answer
any
questions
you
have
lectures
the
purpose
of
class
lectures
is
to
lend
structure
to
the
class
and
tie
the
concepts
together
instructors

also

will
help
with
design
and
development
of
the
coming

and
answer
any
questions
you
have
these
sessions
are
very
important
they
will
help
you
to
gain
problem
solving
skills
and
understand
how
to
write
the
assigned
programs
in
the

the
lab
assistants
will
only
check
off
assignments
answer
brief
questions
about
program
syntax
and
help
you
in
using
the
computers
ta
s
will
not
write
your
programs
for
you
nor
debug
your
program
logic
the
whole
point
of
the
lab
assignments
is
for
you
to
learn
how
to
do
these
tasks
commonly
asked
questions
below
are
questions
that
are
repeatedly
asked
about
cs
142
if
you
don

see
the
answer
to

question
here
review
the
previous
pages
or
talk
to
your

or
lab
assistant
is
there
a
way
to
obtain
extra
credit
no
if
you
have
time
to
do
extra
credit
work
you
have
time
to
do
an
assignment
correctly
is
it
okay
to
study
with
someone
else
yes
group
study
is
very
helpful
for
some
however
don
t
let
someone
else
write
your
programs
for
you
or
you
will
be
unable
to
pass
the
tests
who
makes
up
the
exams
do
individual
teachers
do
that
standard
exams
are
used
for
all
sections
of

what
happens
to
my
program
if
it
is
only
partially
finished
and
the
lab
closes
or
i
have
to
leave
do
i
lose
it
you
won
t
lose
it
if
you
save
it
out
to
your
floppy
disk
you
can
then
work
on
it
some
more
next
time
you
re
in
the
lab
it
s
a
good
idea
to
save
your
program
periodically
as
you
work
even
if
you
re
not
going
to
leave
the
lab
some
programming
errors
can
cause
your
work
station
to
hang
up
so
that
you
must
power
it
off
and
on
to
get
it
working
again
when
this
happens
you
lose
everything
you
did
since
you
last
did
a
save
the
borland
pascal
ide
provides
for
automatic
periodic
saving
of
the
program
you
are
editing
to
take
advantage
of
this
feature
check
the
auto
save
editor
files
box
of
the
preferences
dialog
under
the
environment
option
of
the
options
menu
what
if
i
don
t
have
the
program
finished
by
the
time
it
is
due
you
have
ten
late
days
you
may
use
without
penalty
those
days
could
all
be
used
for
one
assignment
or
one
day
for
each
of
ten
assignments
or
other
combinations
after
the
late
days
are
used
you
will
lose
a
point
for
each
day
subsequent
assignments
are
late
am
i
ever
allowed
to
play
computer
games
no
never
absolutely
not
not
even
if
you
re
the
only
person
in
the
lab
can
i
play
around
on
the
machine
just
to
see
how
to
use
it
yes
by
all
means
do
so
try
entering
and
running
the
example
programs
in
your
text
or
modifying
your
programming
assignments
once
you
ve
passed
them
off
what
if
i
already
have
a
diskette
if
you
have
a
3
5
inch
disk
fine
if
you
are
using
someone
else
s
disk
make
absolutely
sure
that
he
or

is
finished
with
it
and
that
the
disk
is
formatted
for

in
any
case
you
still
need
to
purchase
two

cards
for

have
my
own

is

7
0
on

if
you
want
to
use

you
should
have

compaq
etc
and
your

you
will
also
need
to
get
a
copy
of
the
cs142
and
turtles
units
from
one
of
the
lab
tas
you
must
still
bring
your
programs
into
the
lab
to
pass
off
what
if
i
have
a
non
ibm
compatible
computer
if
you
have
a
pascal
compiler
on
it
you
can
use
it
to
learn
some
things
about
pascal
but
it
won
t
have
windows
or
the
cs142
and
turtles
units
so
you
won
t
be
able
to
write
the
programming
assignments
on
it
what
is
the
best
way
to
schedule
time
in
the
lab
all
in
a
single
block
or
in
separate
hours
most
people
do
best
if
lab
hours
are
spread
out
through
the
week
some
people
get
up
tight
if
they
sit
very
long
at
a
terminal
we
recommend
that
you
design
and
write
your
programs
on
paper
before
going
into
the
lab
to
enter
and
debug
them
will
classes
be
held
the
week
of
exams
yes
always
and
be
sure
not
to
miss
your
exams
plan
to
take
the
exams
at
the
times
scheduled
only
in
rare
cases
will
make
up
tests
be
given
what
can
i
do
if
i
need
more
help
three
things
help
sections
a
schedule
is
posted
in
the
lab
see
your
instructor
during
his
or
her
office
hours
individual
t
a
assistance
may
be
arranged
hire
a
tutor
the
tutoring
service
is
run
by
the
student
academics
office
and
free
lance
tutors
often
advertise
on
bulletin
boards
and
in
the
daily
universe
can
i
share
a
disk
with
someone
not
recommended
you
need
your
own
disks
do
the
help
sections
really
help
yes
they
are
very
useful
in
helping
students
understand
how
to
complete
lab
assignments
students
who
attend
usually
are
very
positive
in
their
evaluation
of
the
help
sections
one
interesting
observation
failing
students
are
almost
never
regular
attendees
of
the
help
sections
how
can
i
get
the
most
out
of
this
class
i
feel
uncomfortable
in
large
classes
there
is
no
reason
to
be
wary
of
large
classes
studies
show
that
unless
the
class
is
very
small
less
than
a
dozen
students
the
size
of
the
class
has
no
correlation
to
the
amount
of
learning
that
takes
place
much
of
your
learning
will
take
place
in
the
lab
anyway
the
best
way
to
learn
pascal
or
any
other
programming
language
is
to
write
as
many
programs
in
it
as
you

real
life
motions
are
periodic
in
some

for

most
human
locomotory
motions

walking
running
skipping
shuffling
are
periodic
in
a
frame
of

that
moves
with
the
person
we
have
developed
an
approach
for
determining
if
an
image
sequence
could
have
been
produced
by
an
object
whose
motion
is
periodic
in

the

this

describing
the

of

without

the

a

this

to
the
government
s
jurisdictional
statement
introduction
during
much
of
this
century
the
mass
media
has
been
characterized
by
a
limited
number
of
speakers
transmitting
programming
and
information
to
essentially
passive
audiences
the
communications
medium
of
the
twenty
first
century
the
internet
and
cyberspace
generally
is
changing
that
and
will
allow
hundreds
of
millions
of
individuals
to
engage
in
interactive
communication
on
a
national
and
global
scale
never
before
possible
the
public
square
of
the
past
with
pamphleteering
soap
boxes
and
vigorous
debate
is
being
replaced
by
the
internet
which
enables
average
citizens
to
participate
in
national
discourse
publish
a
newspaper
distribute
an
electronic
pamphlet
to
the
world
and
generally
to
communicate
to
and
with
a
broader
audience
than
ever
before
possible
it
also
enables
average
citizens
to
gain
access
to
a
vast
and
literally
world
wide
range
of
information
the
communications
decency
act
quot
cda
quot
or
the
quot
act

represents
congress
first
attempt
to
regulate
speech
content
in
this
promising
new
medium
unfortunately
congress
undertook
this
task
without
holding
any
hearings
regarding
the
likely
impact
of
the
cda
on
that
medium
in
the
name
of
protecting
children
from
inappropriate
material
they
might
encounter
online
congress
clumsily
attempted
to
graft
regulations
developed
in
the
quot
dial
a
porn
quot
context
onto
this
very
different
indeed
unique
mode
of
communication
after
making
precisely
the
kind
of
inquiry
congress
failed
to
make
that
is
undertaking
five
days
of
evidentiary
hearings
and
considering
massive
amounts
of
documentary
evidence
including
extensive
stipulated
facts
the
three
judge
district
court
below
preliminarily
enjoined
enforcement
of
provisions
of
the
cda
that
effectively
ban
quot

quot
and
quot
patently
offensive
quot

the
district
court
unanimously
held
that
appellees
are
likely
to
succeed
in
their
claim
that
this
ban
violates
the
first
amendment
3
that
judgment
was
clearly
correct
nevertheless
appellees
appreciate
that
this
case
raises
important
constitutional
questions
regarding
the
application
of
traditional
first
amendment
principles
to
a
new
and
increasingly
important
medium
of
communication
and
therefore
recognize
that
the
court
is
likely
to
grant
plenary
review
regardless
of
the
strength
of
the
district
court
s
decision
although
we
believe
the
judgment
below
could
be
summarily
affirmed
we
understand
that
in
this
case
of
first
impression
the
court
may
prefer
to
engage
in
a
more
comprehensive
examination
of
this
new
medium
and
of
the
extensive
record
compiled
below
we
agree
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
plenary
review
may
be
appropriate
even
if
as
we
believe
the
judgment
below
is
plainly
correct
accordingly
we
do
not
oppose
the
government
s
request
for
plenary
review
4
however
we
do
believe
it
is
particularly
important
in
this
case
of
first
impression
that
the
court
have
a
clear
understanding
of
precisely
what
was
argued
and
decided
below
for
example
the
government
did
not
argue
below
as
it
apparently
does
here
that
sections
223
a
1
b
and
223
d
1
a
of
the
cda
criminalize
quot
indecent
quot
or
quot
patently
offensive
quot
speech
only
when
the
speaker
knows
that
the
only
recipients
of
the
speech
are
all
under
18
years
of
age
moreover
the
government
s
jurisdictional
statement
frequently
ignores
dispositive
findings
of
fact
the
government
does
not
argue
are
erroneous
accordingly
we
submit
this
response
in
order
to
present
a
more
complete
picture
of
what
was
and
was
not
decided
below

critical
factual
findings
that
1
it
is
impossible
or
infeasible
for

to

the
cda
s
affirmative
defenses
2
because
of
the
global
nature
of

the
cda
will
not
effectively
shield

options

these
findings
undergird
the
district
court
s
legal
conclusions
that
the
act
effectively
bans
constitutionally
protected
speech
among

would
not
substantially
further
the
government
s
stated
interest
in
shielding
minors

speech
and

not
the
least
restrictive
means
available

serve

interest
1
impossibility
and
infeasibility
of
compliance
the
district
court
received
extensive
evidence
from
numerous
experts
and
other
witnesses
and
carefully
considered
the
different
methods
of
communication
over
the
internet
based
on
this
body
of
evidence
the
court
made
its
general
factual
finding
that
quot
o
nce
a
provider
posts
content
on
the
internet
it
is
available
to
all
other
internet
users
worldwide
quot
j
s
app
47
a
for
most
methods
of
communication
over
the
internet
the
court
concluded
that
it
simply
is
not
possible
for
a
speaker
to
restrict
the
availability
of
his
or
her
speech
to
adults
for
example
the
district
court
specifically
considered
the
ability
of
a
speaker
posting
a
message
to
a
usenet
newsgroup
to
comply
with
the
cda
the
court
found
that
messages
on
newsgroups
are
quot
disseminated
using
ad
hoc
peer
to
peer
connections
between
approximately
200
000
computers
called
usenet
servers
around
the
world
quot
j
s
app
23
a
and
that
the
quot
dissemination
of
messages
to
usenet
servers
around
the
world
is
an
automated
process
that
does
not
require
direct
human
intervention
or
review
quot
id
at
23
a
24
a
because
of
this
structure
the
court
found
as
a
fact
that
quot
once
a
user
posts
a
message
to
a
newsgroup
that
message
becomes
available
to
all
subscribers
to
that
newsgroup
or
bulletin
board
quot

the
court

available
not
just
in

also
in
provo
and
prague
quot
id
at
48
a
the
court
specifically
further
found
that

individuals
posting
a
message
to
a
newsgroup
cannot
ensure
that
all
readers
are
adults
quot
id
at

a

added
noting
that
even
the
government

expert
agreed
with

conclusion
the

reached
the
same
conclusions
about
e
mail
mail
exploders

known
as
listservs

rooms
and
muds
and

the
court
found
as
a
fact

there
is

no
effective
way
to
determine
the
identity
or
age
of

who
is

court
specifically
noted

agreed
that
no
current

give
a
speaker
assurance
that

mailing
list
quot
id
at

the

based
its
finding
that
individuals
quot
engaging
in

discussions
cannot
ensure
that
all

are
adults
quot
in
part
on
the
fact
that

agreed

similarly
with

a
fact
that

quot
id
at
51
a
with
respect
to
the
world
wide
web
which
is
one
method
of
communication
on

the
court
found
that

a
there

interrogate
a

using
a
computer
program
called

the

found
as

the

concluded
that

are
effectively
unavailable

constitute
the

a
for
example
the
distinct
court
found
as
a
fact
that

effectively
unavailable
to
a
substantial
number
of

a

defense
to

quot
id
at

the
district
court
similarly
considered
the

quot
defense
and
found
as
a
fact
that
the
quot
burdens
imposed
by
credit
card
verification
and

password
verification
systems
make
them
effectively
unavailable
to
a
substantial
number
of

content
providers
quot
id
at
56
a
finally
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
the
government
s
quot
tagging

proposal
would
not
allow
a
speaker
to
ensure
that
a
listener
is
not
a
minor
id
at
57
a
58
a
chief
judge
sloviter
summarized
the
court
s
factual
conclusions
as
follows
we
have
found
that
no
technology
exists
which
allows
those
posting
protected
but
indecent
material
on
the
category
of
newsgroups
mail
exploders
or
chat
rooms
to
screen
for
age
speakers
using
those
forms
of
communication
cannot
control
who
receives
the
communication
and
in
most
instances
are
not
aware
of
the
identity
of
the
recipients
if
it
is
not
feasible
for
speakers
who
communicate
via
these
forms
of
communication
to
conduct
age
screening
they
would
have
to
reduce
the
level
of
communication
to
that
which
is
appropriate
for
children
in
order
to
be
protected
under
the
statute
this
would
effect
a
complete
ban
even
for
adults
of
some
expression
albeit
quot
indecent
quot
to
which
they
are
constitutionally
entitled
even
as
to
content
providers
in
the
other
broad
category
such
as
the
world
wide
web
where
efforts
at
age
verification
are
technically
feasible
through
the
use
of
common
gateway
interface
cgi
scripts
the
findings
of
fact
show
that
as
a
practical
matter
non
commercial
organizations
and
even
many
commercial
organizations
using
the
web
would
find
it
prohibitively
expensive
and
burdensome
to
engage
in
the
methods
of
age
verification
proposed
by
the
government
and
that
even
if
they
could
attempt
to
age
verify
there
is
little
assurance
that
they
could
successfully
filter
out
minors
j
s
app
74
a
in
their
findings
of
fact
the
three
judges
below
found
as
facts
that
many
speakers
who
display
arguably
indecent
content
on
the
internet
must
choose
between
silence
and
the
risk
of

a
emphasis
added

ineffectiveness
of
the
cda
the
district
court
also
made
specific
factual
findings
demonstrating
that
because
a
substantial
percentage
of
all
of
the
indecent
or
patently
offensive
speech
that
is
available
on

is
posted
abroad
the
cda
will
not
be
effective
in
its
claimed
goal
of
preventing
children
from
accessing
that
material
the
court
found
that
a

large
percentage
perhaps
40
or
more

of
content
on
the
internet

originates
outside
of

argues
that

is

to
the

the

introduced
limited
evidence
that
certain
commercial
quot
pornographers
quot
already
use
credit
cards
or
adult
id
verification
systems
but
as
judge
dalzell
explained
these
providers
will
be
largely
unaffected
by
the
act
precisely
because
they
already
require
credit
cards
to
obtain
access
to
virtually
all
of
their
posted
content
even
if
the
act
were
struck
down
commercial
pornographers
would
continue
to
require
credit
cards
as
they
did
before
the
cda
was
enacted
because
they
do
not
want
to
provide
their
speech
for
free
to
the
extent
they
offer
advertising
quot
teasers
quot
free
of
charge
the
act
would
require
them
to
charge
for
those
images
as
well

the

s

on

cannot
be

three
judge
district
court
addressing
a
separate
and
somewhat
narrower
challenge
to
the
cda
unanimously
reached
the
same
conclusion
see
shea
v
reno
930
f
supp
916
s
d
n
y
1996
the
government
has
filed
a
jurisdictional
statement
in
shea
no
96

urging
this
court
to
hold
shea
pending
resolution
of
this
case
appellees
agree
that
is
the
proper
approach
4
we
note
that
the
government
has
not
urged
summary
reversal
we
note
also
that
the
plaintiffs
appellees
aclu
et
al
in
the
consolidated
case
have
moved
for
summary
affirmance
obviously
appellees
in
this
case
would
welcome
that
resolution
and
our
belief
that
the
court
would
probably
prefer
plenary
review
should
not
be
understood
as
casting
any
doubt
on
the
strength
of
that
motion

thus
user
based
blocking
is
far
more
effective
than
the
speaker
based
blocking
required
by
the
cda
because
only
user
based
blocking
will
prevent
minors
from
accessing
the
substantial
percentage
of
all
indecent
speech
that
is
posted
abroad
and
unlike
speaker
based
blocking
which
effectively
prohibits
adults
from
gaining
access
to
the
blocked
speech
user
based
blocking
enables
parents
to
gain
access
to
the
speech
themselves
while
denying
access
to
their
children
7
two
judges
also
concluded
that
the
cda
is
unconstitutionally
vague
in
particular
judges
sloviter
and
buckwalter
agreed
that
the
terms
quot
indecent
quot
and
quot
patently
offensive
quot
quot
in
context
quot
are
so
vague
as
to
violate
the
first
and
fifth
amendments

these
judges
were
clearly
correct
notwithstanding

court
s
distinguishable
decision
in
denver

telecomm

v
fcc
116
s
ct

however
because
the
district
court
s
decision
can
and
should
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
its
first
amendment
holding
there
is
no
need
for
the
court
to
reach
the
vagueness
issue
8
the
government
wisely
has
not
resurrected
its
argument
suggested
but
not
seriously
urged
below
that
an
quot
intermediate

quot
standard
drawn
from
fcc

instead
clearly
such

standard
is
not
applicable

there
is
no
plausible
analogy
to
the
spectrum

is
the

characterized
by
the
pervasiveness

intrusiveness
the

found
noteworthy
about

9
in
the
context
of
strict
scrutiny
the
court
should
consider
only
the
precise
interests
the
government
identified
and
urged
below
as
the
justification
for
the
law
it
should
not
credit
new
interests
advanced
only
on
appeal
and
as
to
which
the
court
below
had
no
opportunity
to
take
evidence
or
pass
upon
cf
edenfield
v
fane
113
s
ct
1792

1993
in
any
event
the
government
cites
no
legal
support
and
there
is
none
for
the
proposition
that
assisting
parents
or
children
to
use
the
internet
is
a
quot
compelling
quot
government
interest
10
indeed
as
the
government
itself
notes
j
s

the
evidence
shows
that
the
number
of
minors
gaining
access
to
the
internet
is
rapidly
increasing
and
to
the
extent
parents
are
concerned
about
their
children
s
access
to
inappropriate
materials
the
district
court
found
that

quot
the

for

is

in
the
absence
of
a
specific
showing

how
this

be
in

tacitly
acknowledges
the
weakness

that

can
survive
strict
scrutiny
when
it
states
that
the
constitutional
issues
posed

prophylactic

to
spare
itself
the
trouble
quot
of
distinguishing
speech
that
is
the
subject
of
legitimate
regulatory
concern
from
speech
that
is

17
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
amount
of
indecent
and
patently
offensive
speech
as
a
percentage
of
the
whole
varies
depending
on
its
country
of
origin
18
for
the
same
reason
the
cda
will
not
directly
and
substantially
further
the
government
s
newly
found
interest
in
expanding
access
to
the
internet
because
foreign
quot

quot

remain
available

of

interpretation
the

still
senselessly

course
overview
this
is
a
basic
course
on
the
design
and
analysis
of
algorithms
the
course
will
focus
on
both
general
classes
of
algorithms
such
as
dynamic
programming
divide
and
conquer
and
greedy
methods
and
advanced
data
structures
such
as
balanced
trees
graphs
and
heaps
in
addition
we
will
compare
different
algorithms
formally
by
analyzing
their
complexity
i
e
running
time
the
problems
we
will
study
involve
sorting
searching
graph
algorithms
computational
geometry
and
a
sprinkling
of
other
topics
which
vary
from
year
to
year
prerequisites
the
official
prerequisite
for
this
course
is
cs109ab
introduction
to
computer
science
or
equivalent
although
this
course
will
be
entirely
a
pen
and
paper
course
i
e
no
programming
familiarity
with
programming
concepts
such
as
pointers
arrays
records
procedures
and
recursion
will
be
assumed
in
addition
a
solid
background
in
mathematics
will
prove
invaluable
for
this
course
in
that
we
will
argue
formally
about
the
correctness
and
performance
of
almost
every
algorithm
and
data
structure
introduced
the
ability
to
write
clear
formal
and
brief
proofs

large
scale
parallel
software
group
william
e
weihl
associate
professor
of
computer
science
and
engineering
researchers
in
the
large
scale
parallel
software
group
develop
new
and
easier
methods
of
writing
efficient
parallel
programs
some
of
the
projects
in
the
group
are
conducted
jointly
with
the
parallel
and
distributed
operating
systems
group
current
research
is
conducted
in
three
major
areas
first
work
that
was
begun
on
the
prelude
system
is
continuing
in
the
autopilot
project
with
compiler
modifications
for
c
and
other
widely
used
languages
the
goal
of
this
work
is
to
develop
compiler
and
runtime
system
mechanisms
that
raise
the
level
of
abstraction
of
parallel
programs
thus
making
it
easier
to
port
or
tune
a
program
secondly
we
are
studying
architectural
and
operating
system
support
for
low
overhead
communication
in
multi
programmed
multi
user
systems
our
goal
is
to
combine
the
speed
of
today
s
high
performance
multiprocessors
with
the
protection
guarantees
of
distributed
systems
thirdly
we
are
developing
new
techniques
for
high
performance
simulation
of
multiprocessor
systems
work
now
under
way
focuses
on
a
parallel
implementation
of
proteus
our
single
processor
simulator
finally
group
members
are
involved
in
several
projects
dedicated
to
designing
and
evaluating
parallel
algorithms
and
applications

a
major
educational
problem
in
united
states
and
some
other
countries
is
that
students
in
grades
k
12
lose
interest
in
mathematics
and
science
as
they
progress
through
school
students
often
complain
that
mathematics
is
difficult
and
that
they
don
t
see
much
use
for
it
past
simple
arithmetic
in
response
to
these
concerns
the
national
council
of
teachers
of
mathematics
has
identified
a
number
of
features
that
the
grades
5
8
curriculum
should
include
in
order
to
help
motivate
students
to
stay
interested
favor
conceptual
learning
over
rote
operations
emphasize
practical
uses
of
mathematics
encourage
discussions
and
group
learning
and
encourage
exploratory
open
ended
learning
the
goal
of
the
metip
project
is
to
use
digital
image
processing
to
help
meet
these
objectives
in
particular
we
have
developed
a
series
of
applications
designed
to
allow
students
to
manipulate
digitized
images
of
their
choice
these
materials
are
intended
to
be
used
in
enrichment
activities
rather
than
part
of
a
standard
classroom
curriculum
teachers
can
play
various
roles
with
these
activities
for
example
they
can
catalyze
student
learning
by
leading
discussions
of
the
concepts
students
have
explored
on
the
computer
the
metip
project
currently
has
a
number
of
programs
that
allow
students
to
explore
mathematics

image
processing

currently
designing
a

which
will
facilitate

of
personal

academic
information
on

which
is
owned
by
the
student
here
is
a
list
of
all
the
people
working
on
the
metip
project
a
closely
related
project
we
are
involved
with
is
the
study
of
multiplayer
educational
activities
the
metip
project
is
working
to
integrate
the
use
of
the
www
into
its
activities
some
ideas
are
described
in
prospects
for
the
direct
use
of
distributed
image
databases
in
educational
image
processing
currently
the
project
is
collecting
the
experiences
of
users
with
its
xform
image
transformation
software
if
you
have
done
something
fun
or
useful
with
the
software
please
let
us
know
we
are
putting
the
current
version
of
its
documentation
online
here
is
a
link
to
it
a
set
of
little
demonstrations
for
xform
has
been
put
together
by
graduate
students
who
took
a
seminar
during
the
winter
of
1996
the
xform
programming
environment
integrated
with
a
subset
of
common
lisp
offers
the
technical
essentials
for
a
new
approach
to
learning
and
teaching
computer
programming
the
fundamental
attraction
of
using
this
approach
is
that
students
learn
to
program
the
computer
in
the
pursuit
of
creating
neat
visual
effects
with
digital
images
portraying
people
or
things
of
interest
to
them
if
you
have
successfully
installed
the
software
and
would
like
to
discuss
teaching
programming

way

objective
the
objective
of
the
paradise
project
is
to
design
implement
and
evaluate
a
scalable
parallel
geographic
information
system
that
is
capable
of
storing
and
manipulating
massive
data
sets
by
applying
object
oriented
and
parallel
database
technologies
to
the
problem
of
storing
and
manipulating
geographic
information
we
hope
to
significantly
advance
the
size
and
complexity
of
gis
data
sets
that
can
be
successfully
stored
browsed
and
queried
client
server
paradise
paradise
is
a
database
system
aimed
at
handling
gis
types
of
applications
paradise
provides
a
graphical
user
interface
for
querying
and
browsing
the
database
and
supports
a
subset
of
sql
for
issuing
ad
hoc
queries
paradise
provides
an
extended
relational
data
model
for
modeling
gis
applications
in
addition
to
support
for
the
base
data
types
such
as
integer
real
and
string
paradise
has
built
in
support
for
raster
polygon
polyline
point
circle
and
video
mpeg
images
data
paradise
uses
shore
as
its
underlying
persistent
object
manager
the
paradise
front
end
allows
you
to
display
objects
with
spatial
attributes
on
a
2
d
map
the
map
provides
a
layered
display
for
overlapping
spatial
attributes
each
layer
corresponds
to
one
query
you
can
customize
the
ordering
and
display
of
the
layers
by
selecting
color
labelling
and
other
display
attributes
for
each
query
the
database
can
be
queried
either
with
a
graphical
interface
or
with
ad
hoc
queries
the
graphical
interface
can
be
be
used
to
issue
implicit
spatial
queries
by
zooming
clicking
and
sketching
a
rubber
banded
box
for
ad
hoc
queries
paradise
provides
a
query
composer
menus
in
the
query
composer
provide
access
to
the
database
schema
to
assist
in
query
composition
query
results
can
either
be
viewed
on
the
2
d
map
if
they
have
spatial
attributes
or
they
can
be
displayed
in
a
table
so
that
you
can
browse
the
tuples
in
the
result
the
front
end
also
provides
context
sensitive
help
paradise
supports
a
subset
of
sql
for
issuing
ad
hoc
queries
to
sql
we
have
added
the
ability
to
invoke
methods
defined
on
the
extended
set
of
types
for
example
you
can
calculate
the
area
of
a
polygon
by
using
the
method
polygon
area
paradise
also
supports
the
standard
database
operations
including
create
and
drop
database
create
and
drop
extent
create
and
drop
indices
insert
and
update
the
current
version
of
paradise
employs
a
client
server
architecture
the
front
end
ships
queries
in
our
sql
syntax
to
the
paradise
server
for
execution
after
executing
the
query
the
server
ships
the
result
objects
back
to
the
client
the
paradise
server
is
multi
threaded
so
that
multiple
clients
can
connect
to
the
same
server
in
designing
and
implementing
the
paradise
sever
careful
attention
was
paid
to
insure
that
the
system
could
efficiently
process
queries
especially
those
involving
spatial
attributes
on
large
volumes

software
quality
assurance
is
the
planned
and
systematic
pattern
of
actions
necessary
to
provide
adequate
confidence
that
a
software
product
or
system
conforms
to
established
technical
requirements
we
will
study
concepts
of
software
quality
the
means
for
defining
measurable
quality
characteristics
as
well
as
techniques
for
ensuring
that
quality
is
present
in
software
products
this
will
include
activities
such
as
specifying
quality
requirements
performing
product
reviews
developing

friday

is
treated
as
class
day
project
in
this
course
we
will
not
only
talk
about
operating
systems
we
will
actually
build
one
while
doing
this
you
will
realize
that
writing
os
code
is
to
programming
your
typical
application
like
nascar
racing
to
driving
your
mom
in
law
to
sunday
brunch
if
you
don
t
like
the
smell
of
burning
tires
forget
it
if
you
need
somebody
to
hold
you
by
the
hand
like
memory
protection
you
are
in
really
bad
shape
fortunately
for
you
most
of
the
machines
here
are
used
by
real
people
trying
to
get
real
work
done
they
and
the
system
support
staff
would
resent
it
heavily
if
we
started
tinkering
with
the
operating
system
on
some
of
the
machines
in
this
semester
we
will
therefore
be
playing
with
and
improve
upon
a
simulated
operating
system
the
simulation
is
rather
sophisticated
and
simulates
the
system
to
quite
some
detail
the
implementation
of
that
system
is
such
that
you
should
be
able
to
concentrate
on
the
os
issues
and
not
have
to
worry
about
the
simulation
nevertheless
you
will
be
exposed
to
quite
some
tricky
situations
which
will
foster
your
understanding
of
what
is
or
at
least
what
should
be
going
on
in
an
os
the
environment
for
the
projects
is
written
in
c
which
gives
a
nice
opportunity
to
some
of
you
to
get
a
little
experience
in
writing
simple
object
oriented
code
simple
i
nbsp
mean
from
an
object
oriented
standpoint
the
code
itself
will
be
rather
sophisticated
for
the
students
who
are
not
familiar
with
c
a
short
introduction
of
the
most
important
concepts
will
be

in

the
course
problem
solving
is
a
pervasive
human
activity
but
some
people
are
better
at
it
than
others
part
of
this
difference
in
performance
is
due
to
differences
in
knowledge
of
effective
problem
solving
methods
because
good
problem
skills
are
particularly
important
for
computer
programing
the
art
and
craft
of
problem
solving
has
become
rather
well
developed
within
the
field
of
computer
science
the
techniques
that
have
evolved
within
computer
science
are
general
ones
that
apply
to
non
computer
problem
solving
as
well
in
this
class
we
will
examine
these
techniques
as
they
apply
to
problems
in
general
and
in
the
context
of
being
able
to
make
computers
do
what
you
want
them
to
do
students
will
get
extensive
experience
in
performing
exercises
on
the
computer
both
in
and
out
of
class
these
exercises
will
be
done
in
a
strongly
supportive
computing
environment
no
prior
experience
with
computers
is
presupposed
the
assignments
there
will
be
two
midterms
exams
each
covering
one
section
of
the
course
as
shown
on
the
schedule
over
and
a
final
exam
covering
the
third
section
plus
the
course
as
a
whole
in
addition
there
will
be
homework
assignments
every
week
or
so
for
the
first
half
of
the
course
and
some
sort
of
course
project
during
the
latter
half
exams
1
and
2
will
count
10
and
20
toward
the
course
grade
respectively
the
homework
will
count
20
and
the
project
and
final
exam
will
each
be
25
course
grades
will
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
resulting
final
distribution
of
numerical
scores
my
current
expectation
is
that
about
a
sixth
of
the
class
will
get
a
grades
that
is
a
a
or
a
about
a
third
will
get
b
grades
and
another
third
will
get
c
grades
however
i
reserve
the
right
to
adjust
these
proportions
to
better
reflect
overall
class
performance
for
example
if
it
turns
out
that
this
class
does
somewhat
better
than
expected
then
there
will
be
more
good
grades
if
it
does
worse
then
there
will
fewer
good
grades
i
will
periodically
provide
updated
information
about
the
expected
distribution
of
grades
as
we

the

the
big
three
car

are
chrysler
ford

these
companies
have
spent
the
past
five
years
investing
heavily
in
robot

exerted
by
an
unexpected
demand
for
the
most
popular

as

as
a

major
issues
here
is
the
move
towards
more
and
more
accurate
spot
and
arc
welding
techniques
the
2
mm
car
where
every
robot
weld
is
within
2
mm
of
the
intended
position
on
every
car
that
rolls
of
the
production
line
is
talked
of
as
a
kind
of
holy
grail
of
car
production
and
some
people
even
talk
in
hushed
tones
of
eventually
pushing
the
barrier
even
further
to
achieve
the
1
mm
car
this
has
focused
attention
on
those
techniques
especially
robot
calibration
and
fixture
calibration
that
will
lead
to
a
higher
accuracy
of
offline
programming
current
practice
involves
several
stages
from
simulation
to
offline
programming
first
the
car
is
modelled
in
the
company
wide
cad
system
often
a
sophisticated
mainframe
based
cad
package
like
catia
which
can
handle
models
of
the
complete
car
and
all
the
parts
that
make
up
the
car
then
the
fixtures
are
designed
which
are
to
present
the
parts
to
the
welding
robots
in
a
repeatable
and
predictable
manner
it
is
usually
a
requirement
that
the
fixtures
which
are
created
by
specialist
tooling
companies
under
contract
are
certified
this
means
that
points
on
the
fixture
which
are
to
clamp
the
part
or
the
blocks
against
which
the
part
are
clamped
must
be
measured
very
precisely
using
a
3
d
co
ordinate
measuring
device
these
measurements
are
referred
to
a
co
ordinate
frame
on
the
centreline
of
the
car
using
three
datum
points
on
the
fixture
these
three
datum
points
give
the
position
x
y
z
orientation
a
b
c
and
scaling
factor
associated
with
the
fixture
the
measurements
are
usually
recorded
using
two
manual
theodolites
and
standard
theodolite
triangulation
another
alternative
technique
that
promises
even
higher
accuracies
than
those
achieved
using
theodolites
is
named
photogrammetry
photogrammetry
uses
several
very
high
resolution
electronic
photographs
of
a
target
attached
to
the
fixture
taken
from
different
angles
together
with
standard
image
processing
techniques
to
derive
the
3
d
position
of
the
target
it
has
a
technique
that
has
long
been
used
in
terrain
mapping
using
aerial
photography
and
advanced
stereo
vision
but
is
only
now
finding
an
application
down
on
the
shop
floor
the
first
fixture
is
then
installed
on
the
production
line
and
from
this
the
position
of
the
first
robot
is
defined
again
using
theodolites
the
position
of
the
first
fixture
then
defines
the
position
of
the
second
fixture
and
so
on
all
the
way
down
the
production
line
the
simulation
of
the
robot
programmes
has
usually
been
completed
by
this
stage
using
models
imported
from
the
cad
system
and
off
the
shelf
robot
models
purchased
from
the
simulation
vendor
more
and
more
of
the
simulation
functionality
is
available
on
the
cad
system
for
example
co
ordinate
frames
representing
the
position
and
orientation
of
spot
welds
and
approach
points
and
weld
schedules
indicating
the
motion
type
and
speed
between
points
can
be
defined
in
catia
before
exporting
the
model
to
the
simulation
the
simulation
is
used
to
check
that
the
robots
can
reach
all
the
required
positions
the
wrist
joint
limits
of
the
robot
often
limit
the
orientations
that
are
achievable
and
the
simulation
user
must
work
creatively
to
position
the
robot
base
and
the
robot
tool
a
particular
position
and
orientation
may
not
be
achievable
in
a
given
robot
configuration
for
example
with
the
wrist
pointing
down
or
with
the
elbow
pointing
up
the
configuration
of
the
robot
model
can
be
changed
by
driving
the
robot
using
joint
motion
into
a
different
configuration
before
attempting
the
movement
the
simulation
enables
the
user
to
plan
collision
free
paths
around
the
clamps
holding
the
part
using
via
points
which
must
be
created
in
such
a
way
that
they
do
not
add
excessively
to
the
overall
cycle
time
this
is
the
reason
that
is
so
important
to
derive
reasonably
accurate
cycle
times
from
the
simulation
unfortunately
the
robot
companies
consider
the
motion
algorithms
used
by
their
robot
controllers
to
be
of
such
commercial
value
that
they
will
always
refuse
to
release
these
to
the
simulation
vendors
a
compromise
position
has
been
reached
between
the
simulation
vendors
and
the
robot
vendors
thanks
to
the
strong
encouragement
of
the
car
companies
in
america
and
in
germany
where
black
boxes
unreadable
parts
of
the
robot
controller
software
are
interfaced
to
the
robot
simulation
to
give
accurate
cycle
times
once
the
cycle
times
are
accurate
the
user
may
also
have
reasonable
confidence
that
the
trajectories
between
points
shown
by
the
simulation
are
accurate
and
therefore
that
the
collision
and
near
miss
information
provided
by
the
simulation
is
reliable
a
key
issue
if
simulation
is
to
be
trusted
by
those
on
the
shop
floor
downloading
the
robot
programmes
sometimes
called
tracks
from
the
simulation
to
the
robot
controller
involves
taking
a
disc
containing
the
programme
teachpoint
and
tool
frame
files
from
the
air
conditioned
offices
where
the
cad
and
simulation
specialist
work
down
onto
the
much
harsher
and
unforgiving
environment
of
the
factory
it
is
here
that
most
advocates
of
simulation
and
offline
have
a
rude
awakening
programmes
that
work
fine
in
the
virtual
reality
environment
of
the
robot
simulation
seldom
work
in
the
uncertain
and
unpredictable
and
subtly
different
real
world
robots
are
designed
to
be
extremely
repeatable
but
not
all
that
accurate
repeatabilities
of
0
1
mm
and
accuracies
of
10
mm
or
worse
are
not
unusual
to
understand
the
difference
between
repeatability
and
accuracy
imagine
a
darts
game
the
first
player
is
playing
with
new
darts
and
so
aims
for
a
triple
20
but
instead
puts
all
the
darts
in
the
number
6
with
all
three
darts
close
together
the
darts
are
repeatable
but
not
very
accurate
the
second
darts
player
playing
with
his
own
tried
and
tested
set
of
darts
throws
three
treble
20
s
his
darts
are
not
only
repeatable
but
they
are
also
accurate
to
increase
the
accuracy
of
the
robot
towards
the
same
order
as
its
repeatability
it
must
be
calibrated
each
robot
has
its
own
individual
signature
created
by
the
manufacturing
tolerances
involved
in
making
robots
and
by
the
wear
and
tear
of
crashing
the
robot
into
fixtures
an
all
to
regular
occurrence
and
worse
this
signature
can
be
detected
by
measuring
the
3
d
co
ordinates
of
the
robot
over
a
range
of
positions
and
orientations
throughout
its
envelope
and
then
using
calibration
software
to
produce
a
more
accurate
custom
model
of
the
robot
the
measuring
devices
used
on
the
shop
floor
for
robot
calibration
must
be
cheap
and
relatively
easy
and
quick
to
use
since
up
to
50
measurements
may
be
required
for
each
robot
robotrak
consist
of
three
drums
which
may
be
placed
anywhere
in
the
workcell
from
which
three
cords
are
extended
to
meet
at
the
endpoint
of
the
robot
the
length
of
the
cord
is
indicated
by
the
rotation
of
the
drum
and
from
the
three
lengths
the
x
y
z
position
of
the
endpoint
of
the
robot
may
be
calculated
and
recorded
to
within
a
repeatability
of
0
3
mm
if
a
higher
accuracy
is
required
then
a
laser
tracker
named
smart
may
be
used
smart
is
the
next
generation
of
theodolite
it
tracks
targets
automatically
without
any
manual
intervention
the
key
to
smart
is
a
laser
interferometer
that
measures
distance
very
precisely
so
that
together
with
the
two
angles
representing
the
direction
that
smart
is
pointing
itself
it
is
possible
to
calculate
the
x
y
z
position
of
a
point
instead
of
having
to
use
2
conventional
theodolites
and
triangulation
smart
is
accurate
to
about
0
025
mm
though
this
degrades
to
0
050
mm
under
shop
floor
conditions
of
temperature
change
vibration
and
large
vehicles
trundling
past
robot
simulations
ltd
who
offer
robotrak
and
smart
for
use
with
their
workspace
robot
simulation
calibration
and
offline
programming
software
suggest
that
customers
requiring
accuracies
circa
1
mm
should
use
robotrak
while
customers
requiring
accuracies
much
lower
than
1
mm
should
use
smart
once
the
robot
has
been
calibrated
it
can
be
used
with
a
pointer
of
known
length
as
an
accurate
measuring
device
to
record
the
position
of
the
fixture
datum
points
this
3
point
touch
up
is
often
mistaken
for
robot
calibration
but
is
really
only
used
for
positioning
the
model
of
the
fixture
correctly
relative
to
the
robot
model
within
the
simulation
and
thereby
avoiding
one
of
the
pitfalls
of
offline
programming
finally
the
correct
tool
offset
must
be
defined
on
the
robot
controller
and
on
the
robot
simulation
if
the
dimensions
of
the
tool
are
well
known
then
this
is
a
straightforward
process
but
if
the
tool
dimensions
are
unknown
or
if
the
tool
is
slightly
bent
because
of
a
collision
that
has
occurred
on
the
shop
floor
then
a
tool
calibration
must
be
carried
out
the
robot
programme
created
by
the
simulation
is
really
only
ready
for
downloading
to
the
robot
once
all
the
above
procedures
are
complete
if
one
of
these
steps
is
ignored
or
badly
implemented
then
the
resulting
programme
can
be
anything
from
2
inches
to
a
foot
out
depending
on
the
seriousness
of
the
mistakes
involved
this
is
where
most
of
the
horror
stories
involving
robot
simulation
and
offline
programming
originate
we
took
a
programme
from
and
downloaded
it
to
the
robot
and
the
robot
drove
straight
into
the
fixture
or
we
created
120
offline
programmes
for
the
whole
production
line
and
not
one
worked
first
time
they
all
needed
to
be
touched
up
by
hand
the
final
source
of
error
in
offline
programming
is
a
simple
logistic
one
by
the
time
the
simulation
is
finished
and
ready
for
offline
programming
the
real
workcell
may
been
redesigned
turntables
have
been
introduced
or
removed
additional
robots
have
been
inserted
only
now
its
too
late
to
go
back
and
simulate
because
the
simulation
office
is
working
on
simulations
for
the
next
production
line
the
simplest
way
to
avoid
this
situation
is
to
make
certain
of
the
following
1
one
person
is
responsible
for
the
simulation
from
start
to
finish
the
finish
being
when
the
production
line
is
up
and
running
smoothly
and
there
are
no
more
changes
2
the
simulation
goes
down
onto
the
shop
floor
with
the
offline
programme
where
last
minute
changes
can
be
immediately
introduced
into
the
simulation
microcomputer
based
robot
simulation
packages
which
can
run
on
notebooks
mean
that
nobody
has
an
excuse
for
leaving
the
simulation
up
in
the
design
office
instead
of
taking
it
down
onto
the
shop
floor
where
it
is
really
needed
so
with
all
these
potential
pitfalls
and
inaccuracies
in
robot
simulation
and
offline
programming
is
it
really
worth
attempting
if
you
want
the
answer
come
to
detroit
the
car
companies
will
not
spend
money
on
any
technology
that
doesn
t
produce
savings
that
can
be
measured
in
dollars
and
cents
and
they
see
robot
simulation
and
offline
programming
as
the
revolutionary
technology
that
will
enable
them
to
build
more
cars
quicker
and
at
a
lower
cost
than
ever
before
what
the
big
three
are
using
today
the
rest
of
us
in
manufacturing
will
be
implementing
tomorrow

we
have
devised
a
provably
correct
automated
technique
for
creating
new
views
of
a
scene
from
two
basis
views
of
the
same
scene
the
technique
relies
on
geometric
image
interpolation
known
as
morphing
in
the
graphics
community
to
produce
intermediate
images
although
morphing
techniques
currently
enjoy
widespread
use
their
theoretical
validity
has
not
been
established
in
particular
does
2
d
interpolation
of
two
views
of
the
same
scene
produce
a
sequence
of
physically
valid
in
between
views
of
that
scene
surprisingly
the
answer
is
yes
providing
the
images
first
undergo
a
simple
rectification
procedure
and
certain
assumptions
about
visibility
and
the
projection
process
are
satisfied
the
view
synthesis
work
described
here
uses
automated
stereo
techniques
to
determine
image
correspondences
our
more
recent
work
on
view
morphing
considers
how
user
interaction
may
be
used
to
guide
the
interpolation

best

list
in

alone
and
has
sold
more
than
650

it
has
inspired
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
to
pursue
their
creative
dreams
through
the
comprehensive
12
week
program
according
to
cameron
quot
the
artist
s
way
was
a
book
of
reunion
and
discovery
ah
hah
i
do
have
inside
me
an

an
inner

who
had
been
lost
to
me
the
vein

is
a

you
ve
been

malnourished
neglected
discounted
and
disowned
i
must
restore
you
to

so
we
can

our
adventures
quot
both
books
are
according
to
cameron
quot
the
distillate
of
30
years
of
artistic
practice
quot
it
is
my
belief
and
my
experience
as
a
teacher
that
all
of
us
are
healthy
enough
to
practise
creativity
it
is
not
a
dangerous
endeavour
requiring
trained
facilitators
it
is
our
human
birthright
and
something
we
can
do
gently
and
collectively
creativity
is
like
breathing
pointers
might
help
but
we
do
the
process
ourselves
after
the
vein
of
gold
s
initial
chapter
entitled
setting
out
which
brings
you
up
to
date
on
the
tools
of
the
artist
s
way
there
are
seven
chapters
of
essays
that
house
over
100
creative
tasks
which
take
us
through
the
various
kingdoms
as
a
journey
to
the
heart
of
creativity
the
following
are
two
of
the
seven
kingdoms
cameron
describes
included

a
task

is

don
t

literal
with
yourself
if
your
dominant
memory
of
your
toddler
s
bedroom
is
the
great
green
leafy
tree
outside
the
window
you
can
use
a
picture
of
the
rain
forest
or
even
a
salad
if
that
green
works
for
you
in
conjuring
up
the
association
remember
you
are
both
the
i
and
the
eye
in
this
exercise
it
is
not
necessary
to
know
why
an
image
speaks
to
you
the
fact
that
it
does
is
connection
enough
take
about
20
minutes
and
swiftly
lay
the
images
down
on
poster
board
i
prefer
working
with
old
fashioned

although
there
are
those
who
swear
by
glue
sticks
feel
free
to
add
words
or
glitter
to
outline
with
magic
marker
or
dabble
with
paints
this
is
your
collage
and
it
is
meant
to
reflect
your
child
self
try
to
let
yourself
go
back
to
that
child
and
remember
you
may
want
to
set
aside
time
each
day
for
a
week
to
move
another
five
years
further
with
your
time
capsule
collage
you
may
also
want
to
hang
these
collages
for
a
while
a
hallway
hung
with
a
row
of
them
becomes
a
visual
narrative
time
line
not
unlike
a
home
movie
the
local
painters
were
my
idols
these
artists
too
were
grown
ups
but
they
were

ups
who
could
still
see
their

still

this
course
learn
about
data
communications
and
networks
enhance
your
skills
at
preparing
and
presenting
material
before
an
audience
enhance
your
skills
at
preparing
and
writing
a
significant
survey
paper
the
approach
everyone
will
participate
fully
in
the
class
sessions
each
student
is
expected
to
read
and
reflect
on
forthcoming
material
and
be
prepared
to
help
all
of
us
learn
more
about
data
communications
the
instructor
and
the
students
will
share
the
lecturing
responsibilities
augmented
by
several
presentations
by
computer
science
staff
students
will
write
at
least
one
survey
paper
those
students
who
present
lectures
on
a
topic
will
write
one
paper
other
students
will
write
two
papers
as
a
rough
guide
i
suggest
that
your
total
effort
in
this
course
might
be
distributed
as
follows
preparation
and
follow
up
for
the
course
lectures
50
preparation
and
presentation
of
each
lecture
topic
or
paper
25
i
will
allocate
lecture
topics
based
on
the
needs
of
the
course
and
the
desires
of
the
participants
i
will
attempt
to
have
the
lecture
schedule
firmed
up
by
the
third
class
period
see
the
lecture
schedule
for
the
current
schedule
each
lecturer
will
develop
and
present
the
topic
and
will
make
available
a
list
of
sources
and
other
appropriate
materials
to
allow
the
members
of
the
class
to
prepare
for
and
participate
in
the
lectures
following
your
lecture
you
will
assign
and
grade
a
brief
but
relevant
homework
the
lecture
topics
will
generally
follow
the
structure
of
our
main
textbook
check
guidelines
for
lecturers
for
some
hints
for
preparing
and
delivering
a
good
lecture
for
each
paper
you
write
you
will
propose
a
topic
and
should
secure
my
approval
before
you
commence
serious
work
usually
a
paper
will
be
a
survey
of
the
present
state
of
a
rather
tightly
focused
topic
as
a
general
rule
avoid
surveys
of
broad
topics
you
should
plan
to
treat
your
topic
thoroughly
using
the
most
up
to
date
sources
you
can
find
inevitably
students
ask
how
long
a
paper
must
be
it
is
undesirable
to
make
a
rule
but
i
ll
say
that
a
typical
paper
tends
to
be
perhaps
20
double
spaced
typed
or
printed
pages
the

skills
in
the
structure
style

your
faithfulness
in
responding
to
the
homework
assignments
and
the
quality
of
your
responses
in
sum
the
success
of
a
seminar
course
such
as
this
depends
on
the
active
involvement
of
the
participants
and
the
quality
of
your
participation
will
be
a
criterion
in
the
grading

the
library
can
help
you
obtain
other
material
through
interlibrary
loan
our
textbook
gives
useful
references
at
the
ends
of
its
chapters
i
have
an
extensive
collection
of
textbooks
and

for
the
current

under
which
you
may

guidelines
for
lecturers
we
will
be
on
a
strict
time
schedule
for
our
lectures
and
we
cannot
afford
to
get
off
schedule
therefore
you
must
plan
your
presentations
carefully
and
must
not
assume
that
you
can
take
portions
of
the
lecture
time
of
others
be
aware
of
how
your
topic
fits
into
the
total
plan
consult
with
people
whose
topics
overlap
or
touch
upon
yours
allocate
related
or
overlapping
subtopics
intelligently
among
your
peers
most
of
our
lectures
will
cover
material
presented
in
the
textbook
if
you
are
lecturing
mainly
from
the
textbook
don
t
plan
to
cover
every
subtopic
in
the
book
pick
several
important
subtopics
with
the
instructor
s
help
if
appropriate
and
develop
them
in
reasonable
detail
if
you
are
using
sources
other
than
the
textbook
hand
out
a
list
of
sources
at
least
one
week
in
advance
of
your
lecture
so
that
others
may
have
a
chance
to
prepare
for
your
lectures
put
your
important
sources
on
2
hour
reserve
in
the
swain
library
be
prepared
to
allow
up
to
2
minutes
but
no
more
at
the
beginning
of
your
first
lecture
for
old
business
assign
one
or
two
homework
exercises
related
to
your
topic
select
exercises
that
will
help
illuminate
important
aspects
of
your
topic
make
the
homework
problems
non
trivial
but
not
too
complex
or
time
consuming
you
will
grade
the
homework
for
your
lecture
use
overhead
foils
or
the
chalkboard
as
you
prefer
the
department
will
provide
10
overhead
transparencies
for
your
lecture
if
you
choose
to
use
them
you
will
make
the
transparencies
yourself
either
by
drawing
directly
on
foils
or
by
photocopying
prior
to
your
lectures
prepare
handouts
for
distribution
if
appropriate
when
using
overheads
don
t
use
too
many
and
don
t
crowd
too
much
information
into
each
foil
the
pace
of
a
lecture
is
considerably
faster
with
overheads
than
with
the
chalkboard
and
you
must
allow
your
audience
time
to
absorb
the
material
take
notes
and
develop
questions
with
a
well
prepared
lecture
it
is
common
to
have
too
much
material
you
must
organize
and
prioritize
your
material
so
that
you
can
fit
within
your
allocated
time
without
rushing
if
toward
the
end
of
the
lecture
you
see
that
you
won
t
finish
all
the
good
stuff
you
ve
prepared
don
t
try
to
rush
on
through
new
topics
you
will
give
a
much
better
lecture
if
you
deal
with
your
present
presumably
important
topic
properly
than
if
you
rush
to
present
a
quickie
sketch
of
the
remaining
material
watch
the
time
on
the
other
hand
beware
of
trying
to
get
by
with
insufficient
preparation
if
you
find
yourself
out
of
material
with
30
minutes
remaining
in
the
class
you
will
be
embarrassed
and
the
class
will
be
irritated
and
if
you
don
t
know
twice
as
much
as
you
plan
to
present
and
if
you
haven
t
practiced
your
presentation
you
may
find
yourself
fumbling
at
the
chalkboard
and
botching
your
examples
if
you
need
help
in
judging
how
much
material
is
appropriate
i
ll
be
glad
to
discuss
it
with
you
you
should
encourage
questions
and
discussion
you
are
not
expected
to
be
an
expert
in
your
topic
but
you
should
be
sufficiently
prepared
to
lead
the
discussion
if
there
are
unanswered
questions
you
should
investigate
them
after
your
lecture
and
be
prepared
to
address
them
next
period
if
your
follow
up
discussion
will
take
no
more
than
2
minutes
it
can
be
made
verbally
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
class
meeting
if
it
requires
longer
then

overview
cashmere
stands
for
coherence
algorithms
for
shared
memory
architectures
and
is
an
ongoing
effort
to
provide
efficient
scalable
shared
memory
with
minimal
hardware
support
it
is
well
accepted
today
that
commercial
workstations
offer
the
best
price
performance
ratio
and
that
shared
memory
provides
the
most
desirable
programming
paradigm
for
parallel
computing
unfortunately
shared
memory
emulations
on
networks
of
workstations
provide
acceptable
performance
for
only
a
limited
class
of
applications
cashmere
attempts
to
bridge
the
performance
gap
between
shared
memory
emulations
on
networks
of
workstations
and
tightly
coupled
cache
coherent
multiprocessors
while
using
minimal
hardware
support
in
the
context
of
cashmere
we
have
discovered
that
ncc
numa
non
cache
coherent
non
uniform
memory
access
machines
can
greatly
improve
the
performance
of
dsm
systems
and
approach
that
of
fully
hardware
coherent
multiprocessors
the
basic
property
of
ncc
numa
systems
is
the
ability
to
access
remote
memory
directly
such
a
capability
is
offered
by
a
variety
of
network
interfaces
including
dec
s
memory
channel
hp
s
hamlyn
and
the
princeton
shrimp
given
current
technology
the
additional
hardware
cost
of
ncc
numa
systems
over
pure
message
passing
systems
is
minimal
based
on
this
fact
and
our
performance
results
we
believe
that
ncc
numa
machines
lie
near
the
knee
of
the
price
performance
curve
the
department
of
computer
science
at
the
university
of
rochester
is
building
a
32
processor
cashmere
prototype
significant
part
of
the
funding
comes
in
the
form
of
an
equipment
grant
from
digital

corporation
the
prototype
consists
of
eight

multiprocessors
on
a
memory
channel
network
the
memory
channel
plugs
into
any
pci
bus
it
provides
a
memory
mapped
network
interface
with
which
processors
can
read
and
write
remote
locations
without
kernel
intervention
or
inter
processor
interrupts
end

bandwidth
is
currently
about
40
mb
sec
remote

latency
is
about

the
next
hardware
generation
is
expected
to
increase
bandwidth
by
approximately
one
order
of
magnitude
and
cut
latency
by
half
cashmere
augments
the
functionality
of
the

the
emphasis
of
the
work
of
our

is
to
derive
parallel
and
distributed
programs
in
a
rigorous
manner
the
group
is
supervised
by
jayadev

who
developed
the
theories
we
work
on
the
research
areas
are

areas
we
work
in
wherever
possible
we
give
links
to
papers
that
are
available
electronically
unity
unity
is
a
programming
notation
and
a
logic
to
reason
about
parallel
and
distributed

the
notes
on
unity
is
a
series
of
papers
presenting
various
results
about
unity
and
its
applications
the
notes
assumes
a
basic
understanding
of
the
unity
theory
as
presented
in
chandy
and
misra
s
book
since
the
publication
of
the
book
several
improvements
have
been
made
in
the
theory
some
of
which
are
reflected
in
the
notes
on
unity
jayadev
misra
has
written
a
manuscript
for
a
book
that
presents
the
new
unity
this
includes
the
introduction
of
a
new
temporal
operator
co
for
specifying
safety
see
further
unity
references
for
references
to
other
papers
and
implementations
markus
kaltenbach
is
currently
writing
a
symbolic
model
checker
for
finite
state
unity
programs
called
the
unity
verifier
uv
al
carruth
has
extended
the
unity
logic
to
include
real
time
aspects
of
computing
and
hybrid
systems
powerlists
powerlists
is
a
notation
for
synchronous
parallel
programs
and
circuits
the
data
structure
is
a
list
of
length
equal
to
a
power
of
two
with
two
different
operations
for
balanced
divisions
of
lists
many
parallel
algorithms
have
a
succinct
presentation
and
simple
proofs
in
the
powerlist
notation
jayadev
misra
s
paper
powerlists
a
structure
for
parallel
recursion
presents
the
notation
and
gives
numerous
examples
of
algorithms
and
proofs
of
their
correctness
including
the
fast
fourier
transform
and
batcher
s
sorting
network
will
adams
has
studied
how
different
arithmetic
circuits
such
as
adders
and
multipliers
can
be
specified
and
proved
correct
in
the
powerlist
notation
his
paper
verifying
adder
circuits
using
powerlists
is
available
jacob
kornerup
has
studied
how
powerlist
programs
can
be
mapped
efficiently
to
different
parallel
architectures
specially
hypercubes
see
his
list
of
papers
for
details
seuss
seuss
is
an
offspring
of
the
work
on
unity
it
addresses
the
issue
of
program
composition
by
restricting
how
program
components
can
interfere
with
each
other
for
an
introduction
to
seuss
read
the
overview
of
seuss
a
few

description
programming
is
in
general
the
art
of
solving
problems
the
study
of
computer
programming
is
therefore
the
study
of
solving
problems
with
a
computer
but
it
is
also
much
more
when
a
programmer
writes
a
program
he
or
she
is
actually
constructing
a
model
of
a
process
for
doing
something
such
a
model
is
called
an
algorithm
furthermore
the
programmer
is
concerned
not
only
with
whether
the
program
simply
works
but
also
with
how
well
it
works
and
how
it
interacts
with
both
users
and
other
programs
this
class
is
designed
mainly
to
teach
you
the
art
of
computer
programming
to
that
end
we
shall
try
to
develop
in
you
a
sense
of
style
and
aesthetics
that
will
help
guide
your
programming
efforts
and
we
shall
try
to
develop
your
intuition
about
how
things
work
and
why
you
will
learn
some
of
the
design
principles
that
go
into
the
engineering
of
good
programs
we
shall
teach
you
a
little
computer
science
to
give
you
a
way
of
analyzing
your
programs
and
your
algorithms
and
finding
the
means
to
improve
them
you
will
learn
a
number
of
standard
algorithms
and
some
programming
idioms
standard
ways
of
performing
certain
kinds
of
tasks
to
do
any
programming
we
need
to
choose
a
language
whichever
we
choose
the
language
does
not
place
limits
on
what
our
programs
can
do
but
only
on
what
they
look
like
it
provides
us
with
a
framework
in
which
to
organize
our
ideas
about
processes
and
problem
solving
the
programming
language
we
use
in
this
class
is
scheme
we
have
chosen
it
because
it
provides
a
convenient
mechanism
for
describing
most
of
the
idioms
and
processes
that
programmers
have
found
useful
we
won
t
spend
much
time
teaching
the
details
of
the
language
because
we
don
t
have
to
you
will
find
that
it
is
easy
to
pick
up
as
we
go
along
it
is
often
helpful
to
first
program
using
a
simple
powerful
language
like
scheme
even
if
one
must
then
translate
the
solution
into
a
more
traditional
programming
language
like
c
the
simplicity
of
scheme
allows
us
to
treat
many
computer
science
topics
in
more
depth
than
would
be
possible
if
c
or
c
were
used
for
in
traditional
languages
more
inessential
detail
must
be
mastered
scheme
allows
us
to
give
a
better
impression
of
the
true
joys
and
challenges
of
programming
then
you
will
be
in
a
better
position
to
study
c
in
your
next
computer
science
course
c212
finally
computer
programming
is
still
a
fairly
young
field
and
it
hasn
t
lost
its
sense
of
fun
for
lots
of
people
including
us
we
hope
that
you
will
enjoy
it
as
much
as
we
do
goals
at
the
end
of
the
course
a
student
can
be
expected
to
know
the
following
concepts
and
to
be
able
to
write
good
scheme
programs
the
students
should
be
able
to
use
the
following
data
types
symbols
numbers
booleans
lists
vectors
and
matrices
strings
and
characters
the
students
should
know
how
to
write
programs
in
recursive
iterative
and
imperative
styles
students
should
be
able
to
write
recursive
programs
on
lists
both
those
containing
only
top
level
items
and
those
containing
nested
sublists
tree
recursion
the
students
should
be
able
to
use
procedures
as
first
class
objects
that
is
pass
them
as
arguments
and
also
write
programs
whose
values
are
procedures
this
includes
the
currying
and
composing
of
procedures
the
students
should
understand
the
concept
of
scope
and
environment
they
should
be
able
to
use
locally
defined
procedures
students
should
be
able
to
use
abstraction
both
with
data
in
making
programs
independent
of
the
data
representation
and
also
with
procedures
in
abstracting
the
structure
of
programs
students
should
be
able
to
use
the
input
and
output
routines
and
write
convenient
user
interfaces
for
their
programs
students
should
be
able
to
handle
the
binary
representation
of
numbers
students
should
know
some
of
the
standard
sorting
routines
e
g
insertion
sort
o
n
2
mergesort
and
quicksort
o
n
log
n
and
understand
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
they
should
also
be
able
to
write
both
linear
and
binary
search
programs
students
should
know
how
to
mutate
various
data
structures
including
lists
vectors
strings
in
addition
they
should
understand
side
effecting
variables
students
should
be
able
to
read
programs
and
have
an
appreciation
of
what
constitutes
good
programming
style
they
should
be
aware
of
the
relative
efficiency
of
programs
certain
topics
will
be
included
if
time
permits
these
include
such
things
as
writing
and
using
syntactic
extensions
developing
an
object
oriented
programming

literate
programming
every
programmer
knows
that
programs
must
be
comprehensible
to
the
computer
the
programming
language
implementation
complains
when
they
are
not
but
with
some
practice
it
is
generally
easy
to
solve
such
problems
what
is
less
appreciated
is
that
programs
must
also
be
comprehensible
to
the
programmer
otherwise
the
programmer
cannot
have
any
confidence
that
the
program
is
correct
a
program
may
easily
be
comprehensible
to
the
computer
but
not
do
what
is
intended
and
only
the
programmer
knows
what
is
intended
in
most
cases
it
is
also
essential
that
programs
be
comprehensible
to
other
programmers
though
this
is
not
typical
of
student
programming
experience
in
the
real
world
programmers
spend
most
of
their
time
modifying
huge
programs
that
were
developed
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
many
other
programmers
modifying
someone
else
s
code
or
even
your
own
a
few
months
later
may
be
a
joy
or
a
nightmare
depending
on
how
clearly
the
program
is
written
thus
we
emphasize
the
importance
literate
programming
writting
programs
that
are
easy
to
understand
relative
to
the
difficulty
of
the
problem
they
solve
literate
programming
is
almost
always
more
important
than
other
programming
goals
such
as
efficiency
and
code
compactness
though
efficiency
and
compactness
are
often
byproducts
of

this
little
book
is
the
best
introduction
to
recursive
programming
that
we
know
of
and
is
designed
for
self
study
recursion
is
used
throughout
this
course
but
some
students
require
extra
material
before
they
feel
comfortable
using
it
if
you
are
having
any
difficulty
mastering
recursion
we
strongly
recommend
that
you
get
this
book
and
study
it
on
your
own
interpreters

macs

all

must
run
under
chez
scheme
it
is
recommended
that
you
use
the
ucs
university
computing
services
machines
named
copper
and
zinc
new
students
should
have
a
network
id
and
instructions
for
creating
copper
and
zinc
accounts
as
soon
as
you
have
your
account
you
should
configure
it
to
run
emacs
scheme
within
emacs
and
the
handin
program
this
is
done
by
entering
c211
setup
hitting
return
and
logging
out
you
only
have
to
do
this
once
when
you
login
the
next
time
your
account
will
be
configured
for
c211
you
have
to
configure
both
your
copper
and
zinc
accounts
assignments
will
be
posted
on
or
before
wednesday
afternoon
and
will
be
due
electronically
by
5
00
p
m
on
the
wednesday
of
the
following
week
any
written
material
will
be
due
at
the
beginning
of
the
lecture
on
that
thursday
or
friday
late
assignments
will
not
be
accepted
in
computing
the
semester
assignment
average
the
lowest
assignment
grade
will
be
dropped
although
assignments
count
for
only
10
of
the
final
grade
it
is
essential
that
you
do
the
assignments
to
master
the
material
computer
programming
like
playing
a
musical
instrument
can
only
be
mastered
through
lots
of
practice
programming
assignments
are
submitted
using
the
program
c211
handin
in
the
directory
c211
bin
on
copper
and
zinc
the
handin
program
evaluates
and
grades
your
program
s
behavior
and
the
results
are
returned
to
you
almost
immediately
via
email
since
zinc
allows
e
mail
to
be
sent
but
not
received
you
will
have
to
read
the
grading
results
on
the
machine
where
you
normally
read
your
mail
you
may
correct
and
resubmit
your
programs
as
many
as
five
times
until
the
announced
deadline
the
highest
grade
recorded
for
the
assignment
will
be
the
one
that
is
entered
into
the
class
gradebook
in
this
course
you
may
discuss
assignments
with
other
students
do
not
assume
this
is
true
in
all
your
courses
we
expect
you
to
actually
think
through
and
fully
understand
assignment
solutions
we
have
found
that
students
who
copy
someone
elses
work
and
turn
in
something
they
do
not
fully
understand
usually
fail
the
examinations
and
the
10
added
by
having
good
assignment
grades
is
insufficient
to
pass
the
course
teamwork
in
doing
assignments
is
good
as
long
as
each
member
of
the
team
contributes
and
fully
understands
the
programs
this
certainly
means
that
you
should
not
put
your
name
on
a
file
written
by
someone
else
and
submit
it
as
your
own
work
after
the
final
submission
of
an
assignment
it
will
not
only
be
electronically
graded
but
an
associate
instructor
will
also
grade
the
assignment
for
style
good
programming
style
makes
it
easier
to
get
your
programs
working
and
also
develops
the
habit
of
literate
programming
which
as
we
have
already
noted
is
of
great
importance
in
developing
large
programs
in
this
course
good
style
is
also
rewarded
in
the
evaluation
of
exams
for
scheme
programming
consistent
use
of
a
suitable
style
of
program
indentation
is
essential
and
violation
of
the
first
cardinal
rule
of
indentation
will
automaticaly
result
in

however
that

be
expected
to
complete
a
related
project
chosen
in
consultation
with
one
of
the
instructors
the
project
cannot
serve
also
as
a
master
s
project
however
if
a
two
phase
proposal
is
accepted
by
the
instructor
the
second
phase
can
serve
as
a
ms
project
students
may
form
teams
to
work
on
projects
however
the
project
scope
must
scale
linearly
with
the
team
size
and
work
must
be
explicitly
load
balanced
in
a
fair
way
it
s
also
ok
to
take
this
course
for
no
credit
but
to
use
it
to
lead
on
to
an
ms
project
during
a
subsequent
semester
we
will
schedule
a
brownbag
or
two
at
the
end
of
the
semester
each
student
participating
will
be
asked
to
talk
for
a
short
time
10
mins
on
their
project
or
on
a
related
topic

conclusion
given
that
the

has
been
so

already

is
filing
formal
complaints
with
the
central

about
unfair

coverage

access
and

will
certainly
be
on

yeltsin
may
be
inclined
to
limit
coverage
of
the
communist
opposition
on
television
or
temporarily
close
communist
newspapers
as
he
did
after
suppressing
the
1993
parliamentary
rebellion
since
then
faced
with
an
even
more
contentious
parliament
and
an
unending
war
in
chechnya
yeltsin
has
strengthened
the
president
s
security
apparatus
and
allowed
the
fsb
interior
ministry
and
military
to
harass
journalists
unchecked
meanwhile
investigations
have
languished
or
have
not
even
been
started

a
grim
signal

urges
the

to

blurb
there
are
many
approaches
to
formal
reasoning
the
objective
of
specifying
computer
programs
including
the
formalization
of
worlds
with
which
programs
are
to
interact
has
led
to
the
creation
of
numerous
tools
for
formal
reasoning
we
will
examine
some
systems
for
formal
reasoning
while
examining
a
number
of
mechanical
formal
methods
tools
that
support
these
different
systems
examples
of
such
system

pairs

1994
course
overview
the
goal
of
logic
programming
is
to
allow
us
to
specify
what
properties
a
correct
solution
to
a
problem
must
possess
and
then
automatically
deduce
the
solution
without
further
programming
it
is
a
unique
paradigm
suitable
for
many
non
numeric
applications
and
has
connections
with
a
variety
of
areas
of
computer
science
including
automatic
theorem
proving
deductive
database
and
various
ai
applications
such
as
natural
language
processing
expert
systems
and
knowledge
representation
the
principal
focus
of
this
course
will
be
on
the
semantics
and
pragmatics
of
prolog
programming
and
its
aptness
for
logic
programming
general
background
from
the
formal
prerequisites
22
c
21
and
22
c
23
will
be
assumed
there
will
be
no
prior
knowledge
of
logic
programming
required
necessary
background
for
course
topics
will
be
developed
it
will
be
assumed
that
the
student
has
experience
with
several
programming
languages
and
especially
that
recursion
is
a
familiar
concept
please
note
that
undergraduate
majors
can
select
this
course
as
one
of
the
two
advanced
cs
courses
required
for
the
b
s
degree
the
course
will
involve
both
conceptual
and
project
work
the
projects
will
be
of
modest
size
and
will
use
prolog
and
possibly
other
logic
languages
for
which
implementations
can
be
obtained
a
tentative
listing
below
indicates
the
range
of
topics
it
will
not
be
possible
to
provide
a
complete
treatment
of
all
these

this
work
is
part
of
an
hpcc
project
funded
by
nasa
to
develop
a
state
of
the
art
earth
system
model
esm
that
will
be
comprised
of
a
coupled
atmosphere
and
ocean
system
including
chemical
tracers
that
are
found
in
and
may
be
exchanged
between
the
atmosphere
and
the
oceans
the
starting
point
of
the
esm
model
is
the
ucla
agcm
which
has
been
parallelized
on
different
platforms
and
will
be
coupled
with
gator
a
gas
aerosol
transport
and
radiation
chemistry
model
developed
by
m
jacobson
o
toon
r
turco
and
r
lu
the
ucla
esm
model
will
archive
and
retrieve
model
output
via
the
sequoia
database
coupled
systems
are
an
important
tool
for
helping
scientists
to
understand
complex
phenomena
such
as
el
nino
and
stratospheric
ozone
depletion
a
parallel
version
of
gator
is
being
developed
at
berkeley
by
jim
demmel
and
sharon
smith
gator
models
atmospheric
chemistry
in
the
los
angeles
basin
and
has
been
used
for
detailed
air
pollution
studies
our
task
is
to
parallelize
gator
and
scale
it
to
the
globe
gator
includes
both
gases
and
aerosols
modeling
gas
phase

aqueous

chemistry
radiation

growth
and

horizontal

and
vertical

and
wet

visibility
and
emissions
the
parallel
version
of
gator
a
primary
motivation
for
this
research
is
to
provide
atmospheric
scientists
with
the
best
computational
means
to
further
their
studies
of
the
earth
s
future
climate
since
the
ucla
esm
is
still
evolving
it
is
important
that
the
codes
also
be
portable
so
our
efforts
are
thus
focused
on
developing
portable
parallel
code
that
can
be
performance
tuned
for
different
parallel
architectures
the
main
challenges
in
parallelizing
gator
are
overcoming
problems
due
to
load
imbalance
and
minimizing
the
communication
costs
the
figure
below
shows
the
differences
in
computation
that
can
result
in
load
imbalance
160

in
the
picture
the
z
axis
shows
time
while
the
x
and
y
axis
show
the
latitudinal
and
longitudinal
partitioning
of
the
atmosphere
into
block
columns
each
processor
owns
one
set
of
block
columns
the
difference
in
time
among
the
processors
illustrates
the
amount
of
computation
due
to
solving
odes
that
arise
from
chemical
kinetic
equations
the
largest
amount
of
computation
occurs
in
parts
of
the
globe
that
are
in
the
summer
and
daylight
whereas
the
processors
holding
atmospheric
cells
in
winter
and
night
require
the
least
amount
of
computation
click
here
to
see
the
ode
solver
computation
costs
for
the
world
our
solution
to
the
load
balancing
problem
is
to
use
a
block
cyclic
layout
which
will
collect
different
atmospheric
cells
from
the
different
parts
of
the
globe
together
in
a
single
processor
the
hope
is
that
each
processor
will
have
cells
requiring
different
amounts
of
computation
but
not
all
of
the
computationally
intensive
cells
at
once
the

general
course
goals
i
hope
to
accomplish
several
things
in
this
course
since
this
is
the
first
time
we
ve
done
it
it
s
impossible
to
predict
just
how
much
we
will
be
able
to
cover
in
general
there
are
two
areas
i
want
cover
the
technical
and
the
practical
in
many
cases
these
are
related
but
not
always
the
technical
amounts
to
the
how
to
aspect
of
any
class
we
want
to
learn
how
things
work
and
how
to
use
them
the
practical
is
more
ethereal
it
s
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
t
or
don
t
usually
get
in
technical
classes
ideas
about
problem
solving
professional
growth
and
development
on
the
job
all
those
things
you
need
to
know
about
if
you
re
really
going
to
do
network
administration
as
all
or
part
of
your
job
technical
course
goals
the
technical
goal
of
this
course
is
very
practical
in
nature
we
want
you
to
learn
about
networks
this
includes
some
hardware
networking
topologies
networking
protocols
network
operating
systems
and
desktop
operating
systems
when
you
complete
this
course

you
will
have
a
working
knowledge
of
these
systems
some
more
than
others
i
will
try
to
make
this
experience
as
practical
as
possible
using
what
i
know
about
systems
currently
in
place
in
both
business
and
education
so
that
when
you
are
done
you
can
honestly
say
you
have
some
useful
networking
knowledge
and
experience
grading
ughhh
i
know
this
is
never
fun
but
here
s
what
i
have
in
mind
at
this
point
there
will
probably
be
weekly
or
bi
weekly
homework
assignments
that
will
be
graded
and
represent
15
25
of
the
course
grade
the
labs
will
probably
not
be
graded
since
the
goal
is
use
and
hands
on
experience
however
what
you
do
in
the
labs
will
appear
on
the
exams
or
homework
or
both
so
you
ll
still
have
to
learn
this
stuff
there
will
probably
be
3
4
exams
representing
75
85
of
the
course
grade
evenly
distributed
across
all
the
exams
so
there
will
probably
not
be
a
so
called
comprehensive
final
instead
the
3
rd
or
4
th
exam
will
take
place
during
the
final
exam
time
however
it
s
my
custom
to
design
my
classes
so
each
section
builds
on
the
previous
in
other
words
even
though
the
last
exam
won
t
be
a
final
it
s
unlikely
you
ll
pass
it
unless
you
ve
done
well
on
the
previous
exams
labs
and
homework
you
ll
have
to
know
what
we
ve
already
learned
to
keep
up
finally
don
t
let
any
of
the
above
scare
you
away
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
anyone
enrolled
in
the
course
this
semester
or
interested
in
this
course
in
the
future
has
a
decent
amount
of
information
to
make
an
informed
decision
in
response
to
the
demand
for
this
course
at
this
time
it
appears
it
will

this
paper
introduces
a
simple

to
image
morphing
that
correctly
handles
3

projective
camera
and
scene
transformations
the
technique
called
em
view
morphing
works
by
prewarping
two
images
prior
to
computing
a
morph
and
then
postwarping
the
interpolated
images
because
no
knowledge
of
3
d
shape
is
required
the
technique
may
be
applied
to
photographs
and
drawings
as
well
as
rendered
scenes
the
ability
to
synthesize
changes
both
in
viewpoint
and

affords

conceptual
models
of
computing
a
introduction
could
a
computer
be
conscious
what
would
a
continuous
programming
language
be
like
what
kind
of
materiality
exists
on
the
web
how
will
computation
affect
the
future
of
science
what
about
quantum
and
dna
computers
is
it
ethical
to
give
computers
power
over
human
life
addressing
such
questions
requires
knowing
what
computers
are
and
what
computation
is
to
a
depth
it
is
argued
in
this
course
beyond
that
reached
by
current
theories
come
and
find
out
why
what
we
know
what
we
don
t
know
what
a
more
adequate
theory
would
look
like
a
critical
examination
of
the
conceptual
foundations
of
computing
focusing
on
the
models
and
metaphors
in
terms
of
which
we
understand
computing
from
programs
to
processes
architecture
to
abstraction
parameterization
to
parallelism
and
the
use
of
computational
concepts
in
adjacent
fields
from
cognitive
science
to
physics
economics
to
art
initially
we
focus
on
six
traditional
views
formal
symbol
manipulation
recursive
function
theory
effective
computability
computational
complexity
digital
state
machines
information
processing
and
newell
and
simon
s
notion
of
a
physical
symbol
system
non
standard
views
are
also
considered
such
as
connectionism
non
linear
dynamics
and
artificial
life
throughout
each
view
is
judged
by
its
ability
to
do
justice
to
practice
we
conclude
by
briefly
considering
the
wider
role
of
computational
concepts
in
intellectual
life
including
their
affect
on
our
self
conception

the

strongly
agrees
with

146
s
prediction
and
in

envisions
that
production

are
147
just

148
on

there
is
a
new
and
exciting
revolution
coming
it
will
dramatically
change
our
landscape
our

our

and
our

it
will
provide
each

with
a
truly

it
will
mark
the

the

151
a
time
in
which
we

which
will
power
our

what
made
her
step
off

ladder
ten
years
ago
and
into
the
uncertainty
of
researching
the
non

145
free

146
movement
147
i
was
living
in
vernon
bc
and
heard
about
an
inventor
in
penticton
who
invented
an
extraordinary
magnetic
dynamo
he
named
his
company
pran
tech
because
he
believed
that
powerful
magnets
somehow
suck
in
the
145
prana
146
151
a
subtle
energy
recognized
by
the
ancients
151
from
the
air
around
us
using
a
super
efficient
arrangement
of
permanent
magnets
and
electrical
coils
he
claimed
the
machine
when
fully
developed
would
put
out
more
electricity
than
it
took
to
run
it
147
i
didn
146
t
understand
the
technical
explanations
at
the
time
but
i
was
convinced
that
he
sincerely
wanted
to
help
clean
up
the
planet
with
a
pollution
free
energy
source
i
thought
145
if
this
is
real
we
won
146
t
need
to
dam
any
more
wild
rivers
or
poison
the
air
if
it
is
bona
fide
then
as
a
journalist
i
want
to
spread
the
word
about
it
when
the
time
is
right
148
fifteen
years
later
the
time
was
right
the
coming
energy
revolution
published
in
1996
covers
the
history
of
free
energy
research
explains
the
conceptual
basis
of
this
new
technology
and
introduces
us
to
some
of
the
inventors
their
struggles
failures
and
successes
manning
146
s
research
has
placed
her
in
the
middle
of
an
international
subculture
that
is
151
excuse
the
pun
151
electric
with
excitement
over
recent
developments
in
non
conventional
energy
alternatives
the
scene
is
no
longer
filled
with
garage
inventors
and
145
mad
scientists
146
instead
a
small
but
increasing
number
of
serious
researchers
with
phds
in
physics
or
engineering
is
convinced
that
mainstream
science
texts
will
have
to
be
rewritten
some
of
these
people
publish
articles
in
respected
physics
journals
explaining
that
the
147
zero
point
quantum
fluctuations
of
the
vacuum
of
space
148
could
be
cohered
into
a
usable
energy
source
free
energy
is
a
misnomer
manning
points
out
because
there
is
a
cost
associated
with
building
machines
to
generate
electrical
energy
even
if
the
non
conventional
machines
need
no
fuel
to
operate
however
the
phrase
caught
the
imagination
of
many
people
over
the
years
and
is
now
used
in
some
circles
as
a
slogan
with
145
free
146
as
a
verb
151
147
let
146
s
free
energy
148
today
146
s
energy
researchers
such
as
hal
fox
phd
of
salt
lake
city
prefer
terms
such
as
145
space
energy
146
to
describe
the
incredible
amounts
of
power
available
in
the
so
called
vacuum
of
space
around
us
respected
theorists
say
there
is
enough
potential
energy
in
the
vacuum
in
a
light
bulb
to
boil
all
the
world
146
s
oceans
if
it
could
be
put
to
use
new
energy
theorists
want
to
use
only
a
trickle
of
that
energy
to
give
the
world
a
clean
source
of
power
as
with
the
personal
computer
revolution
20
years
ago
inventors
are
making
breakthroughs
in
home
workshops
and
garages
as
well
as
private
laboratories
observers
of
the
science
underground
predict
that
this
revolution
will
have
even
more
of
an
impact
on
society
than
pcs
have
had
it
could
do
more
than
transform
our
homes
vehicles
and
factories
it
will
also
provide
a
means
to
clean
up
rivers
as
well
as
the
air
and
soils
scrutiny
of
the
emerging
energy
field
reveals
a
complex
picture
with
dark
areas
of
greed
corporate
lobbying
international
energy
politics
bureaucratic
inertia
academic
resistance
secrecy
and
inventors
146
paranoia
147
however
the
bright
spots
of
irrepressible
new
discoveries
are
growing
increasingly
faster
and
are
showing
up
in
unexpected
places
co
operative
efforts
may
win
out
as
leading
edge
scientists
and
many
independent
innovators
from
about
30
countries
now
are
working
towards
the
same
goal
148
manning
has
covered
recent
developments
in
free
energy
technology
for
instance
145
cold
fusion
146
has
been
successfully
repeated
and
japan
for
one
is
investing
millions
of
dollars
into
cold
fusion
research
other
water
fuel
cell
technologies
hold
promise
for
cleaning
up
the
atmosphere
as
they
power
vehicles
revolutionary
advances
towards
clean
abundant
power
also
use
sunshine
and
heat
in
the
air
or
in
the
ground
to
make
electricity
through
super
efficient
solar
photovoltaics
or
advanced
concept
heat
pumps
a
canadian
company
has
developed
efficient
small
scale
generators
which
revolve
in
a
stream
of
water
or
in
ocean
tides
without
harming
marine
life
a
variety
of
prototype

energy
146
devices
apparently
tap
the
energy
in
space
they
include
magnetic
electrostatic
electrodynamic
and
solid
state
ways
to
generate
electricity
except
for
the
initial
cost
of
equipment
and
minimal
maintenance
the
expected
result
will
be
cost
free
electricity
generators
that
access
this
energy
are
now
operating
making
it
likely
that
within
the
next
decade
new
energy
production
methods
will
take
energy
out
of
the
145
air
146
with
no

manning
claims
we
can
look
forward
to
in
the
near
future
include
no
longer
having
to
pay
a
utility
bill
or
buy
gasoline
and
so
being
able
to
lease

151
in
order
to
address
questions
which

have
ignored
up
to
now
he
now
lives
the
challenging
life
of
an
author
and
independent
scientist
he
says
147
because
the
free
energy
that
surrounds
us
is
such
a
vast
resource
so
potentially
clean
and
decentralized
some
of
us
believe
an
energy
revolution
is
imminent
afterward
existing
energy
sources
may
be
seen
as
dinosaur
nightmares
that
littered
our
landscape
and
polluted
our
air
this
revolution
could
open
a
new
paradigm
of
science
and
technology
that
would
make
the
copernican
and
industrial
revolutions
appear
tame
redirecting
2

from

systems
to

is
an
unprecedented
change
with
vast
possibilities

the

could

s

their

profoundly
because
decentralized
power

it

in
this
class
i
will
be
presenting
some
of
the
fundmental
topics
that
form
the
basis
of
research
in
distributed
systems
the
topics
we
will
cover
are
in
no
way
exhaustive
and
of
course
they
reflect
my
own
subjective
biases
i
will
be
using
tanenbaum
s

as
well
as
a
short
collection
of
papers
this
combination
should
help
expose
you
to
both
some
practical
and
well
as
theoretical
aspect
of
distributed
systems
i
expect
you
all
to
read
the
chapters
and
papers
that
i
discuss
in
class
i
strongly
encourage
you
to
come
and
talk
to
me
about
any
distributed
systems
topics
that
are
not
covered
in
this
list
i
expect
to
hand
out

assignments
some
of
these
will
involve
programming
some
of
the
basic
ideas
discussed
in
class
some
of
the
homeworks
may
involve
reading
a
paper
that
is
related
to
the
topic
being
discussed
in
class
i
have
put
several
books
on
reserve
in
the

some
of
which
may

course
description
almost
every
course
in
computer
science
uses
concepts
from
mathematics
it
is
the
aim
of
this
course
to
present
many
of
the
mathematical
topics
that
are
frequently
encountered
while
learning
computer
science
those
who
have
taken
c201
using
scheme
know
the
importance
of
recursion
in
programming
we
start
by
examining
in
more
detail
the
concept
of
recursion
in
chapter
2
entitled
iteration
induction
and
recursion
in
preparation
for
study
in
the
analysis
of
algorithms
we
shall
look
at
the
big
oh
notation
in
chapter
3
throughout
mathematics
we
find
that
graphical
representation
of
ideas
make
them
easier
to
comprehend
the
same
is
true
in
computer
science
and
we
next
go
to
chapter
5
to
discuss
special
graphs
called
trees
as
they
are
used
as
a
data
model
in
computing
sets
are
another
important
mathematical
concept
underlying
much
of
computer
science
and
these
are
treated
in
chapter
7
those
who
work
in
database
theory
know
the
importance
of
the
relational
databases
we
next
study
functions
and
relations
from
a
set
theoretic
point
of
view
chapter
9
presents
a
more
general
discussion
of
graph
theory
than
the
previous
discussion
of
trees
logic
underlies
all
of
computer
science
we
next
cover
propositional
logic
which
makes
up
chapters
12
and
14
of
aho
and
ullman
if
time
permits
in
the
last
part
of
the
course
we
shall
investigate
finite
state
automata
a
way
of
modeling
computation
this
material
is
is
contained
in
chapter
10
if
time
permits
we
shall
also
discuss
turing
machines
and
the
halting
problem
note
that
we
have
skipped
many
of
the
chapters
in
our
text
we
shall
also
skip
over
many
of
the
sections
within
chapters
this
text
is
designed
for
a
year
long
course
which
introduces
students
not
only
to
the
fundamental
ideas
underlying
computer
science
but
also
to
the
important
data
structures
used
in
computing
it
would
be
nice
to
have
enough
time
during
the
semester
to
cover
the
whole
text
but
since
this
is
not
the
case
and
since
the
material
that
we
skip
is
so
interesting
you
might
consider
reading
some
of
the
sections
or
chapters
we
skip
to
get
a
head
start
for
some
of
the
future
courses
homework
assignments
will
be
posted
to
the
class
web
page
regularly
usually
due
the
next
discussion
section
late
assignments
will
not
be
accepted
please
write
your
solutions
to
the
problems
in
a
way
that
will
be
easy
for
the
graders
to
read
and
understand
presentation
of
the
answers
is
a
significant
factor
in
grading
homework
in
this
course
you
may
discuss
assignments
with
other
students
do
not
assume
this
is
true
in
all
your
courses
we
expect
you
to
actually
think
through
and
fully
understand
assignment
solutions
we
have
found
that
students
who
copy
someone
else
s
work
and
turn
in
something
they
do
not
fully
understand
usually
do
poorly
on
the
examinations
which
carry
much
more
weight
in
grading
teamwork
in
doing
assignments
is
good
as
long
as
each
member
of
the
team
contributes
and
fully
understands
the
assignment
if
you
are
working
with
a
group
please
indicate
it
on
your
homework
papers
if
someone
has
given
you
a
lot
of
help
acknowledge
them
you
will
not
be
penalized
and
they
will
get
the
thanks
they
deserve

overview
for

many
designers
say
design
for
the
people
who
will
use
your
designs
and
know
your
users
the
cognitive
sciences
have
developed
a
base
of
knowledge
about
people
in
general
and
a
good
deal
of
it
is
actually
useful
in
interface
design
also
the
common
suggestion
well
go
study
some
people
can
be
performed
better
with
more
trustworthy
results
if
you
have
knowledge
of
testing
techniques
this
course
introduces
a
practical
side
of
the
cognitive
sciences
oriented
to
designers
focused
readings
and
homework
assignments
will
cover
useful
highlights
of
the
theory
and
high
bang
for
the
buck
methodologies
students
will
see
cases
of
when
and
how
different
areas
of
cognitive
theory
may
and
may
not
be
useful
to
design
additionally
students
will
learn
about
and
try
different
testing
methodologies
major

surveyed
this
quarter
will
include

cs

is
targeted
for
designers
a
background
in
cognition
and
perception
is
not
expected
course
topics
are
likely
to
have
little
overlap
with
those
in
psychology
classes
and
the
perspective
will
be
different
where
there
is
overlap
the
course
will
be
oriented
around
weekly
readings
and
regular
homework
assignments
which
exercise
skills
that
support
design
and
analysis
the
midterm
is
likely
to
be
a
take

complementarity
problem
net
as
a
result
of
more
than
three
decades
of
research
the
subject
of
complementarity
problems
with
its
diverse
applications
in
engineering
economics
and
sciences
has
become
a
well
established
and
fruitful
discipline
within
mathematical
programming
several
monographs
and
surveys
have
documented
the
basic
theory
algorithms
and
applications
of
complementarity
problems
and
their
role
in
optimization
theory

miles
miles
is
an
extension
of
the
classical
josephy
newton
method
for
ncp
in
which
the
solution
to
each
linearized
subproblem
is
computed
via
lemke
s
almost
complementary
pivot
algorithm
this
newton
point
is
used
to
define
the
newton
direction
which
is
then
used
in
a
damped
linesearch
the
merit
function
used
measures
both
the
violation
in
feasibility
and
in
complementarity
miles
also
employs
a
restart
procedure
in
cases
where
the
newton
point
cannot
be
computed
due
to
termination
in
a
secondary
ray
every
linearized
subproblem
is
rescaled
to
equilibrate
the
elements
appearing
in
the
data
of
the
subproblem
path
runs
under
gams
mcp
or
directly
under
matlab
the
path
solver
applies
techniques
similar
to
those
used
in
newton
methods
for
smooth
systems
to
a
nonsmooth
reformulation
of
the
mcp
the
algorithm
consists
of
a
sequence
of
major
iterations
each
consisting
of
an
approximation
or
linearization
step
similar
to
that
of
miles
the
construction
of
a
path
to
the
newton
point
the
solution
to
the
approximation
and
a
possible
search
of
this
path
when
the
newton
point
does
not
exists
or
the
path
cannot
be
entirely
constructed
a
step
along
the
partially
computed
path
is
taken
before
the
problem
is
relinearized
a
nonmonotone
watchdog
strategy
is
employed
in
applying
the
path
search
this
helps
avoid
convergence
to
local
minima
of
the
norm
function
for
the
underlying
nonsmooth
equation
and
keeps
the
number
of
function
evaluations
required
as
small
as
possible
a
list
of
solver
options
is
given
in
the
document

the
nonsmoothness

smooth
the
smooth
algorithm
is
based
upon
reformulating
the
ncp
as
a
system
of
nonsmooth
equations
and
then
approximately
solving
a
sequence
of
smooth
approximations
which
lead
to
a
zero
of
the
nonsmooth
system
at
each
iteration
a
smooth
approximation
to
the
original
system
is
formed
where
the
accuracy
of
the
approximation
is
determined
by
the
residual
of
the
current
point
this
is
implemented
as
a

the
committee
to
protect
journalists
cpj
today
hailed
the
court
decision
in
argentina
in
a
libel
suit
brought
by
president
carlos
menem
against
the
newspaper
pagina
12
as
an
important
victory
for
press
freedom
judge
maria
laura
garrigos
de
rebori
said
in
her
dec
17
decision
in
the
more
than
two
year
old
libel
case
that
columnist
horacio
verbitsky
had
only
been
doing
his
job
as
a
journalist
when
he
wrote
that
the
president
had
not
been
tortured
as
he
claimed
during
his
arrest
under
the
military
dictatorship
the
judge
also
acquitted
ernesto
tiffenberg
and
fernando
sokolowicz
editors
of
pagina
12
sued
by
president
menem
and
ordered
menem
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
trial
in
her
verdict
she
said
that
freedom
of
expression
meant
both
the
right
of
the
press
to
inform
and
the
right
of
society
to
be
informed
quot
the
journalist
fulfilled
the
duty
imposed
by
his
job
when
he
said
menem
was
not
telling
the
truth
quot
she
said
in
a
television
interview
quot
this
is
a
major
victory
for
the
argentine
press
at
a
privotal
moment
in
the
country
s
evolution
as
a
democratic
society
quot
said
william
a
orme
jr
cpj
s
executive
director
quot
we
commend
our
argentine
colleagues
in
their
principled
pursuit
of
press
freedom
this
decision
is
particularly
important
because
the
argentine
press
which
is
held
in
high
esteem
by
the
majority
of
people
has
for
years
been
under
legal
assault
by
the
menem
government
quot
president
menem
sued
pagina
12
in
october
1994
for
publishing
the
article
by
verbitsky
that
questioned
the
veracity
of
the
president
s
claims
of
torture
it
was
the
fourth
libel
suit
initiated
by
menem
against
the
paper
which
also
has
been
the
target
of
lawsuits
by
members
of
the
menem
government
cpj
criticized
the
continued
legal
harassment
of
pagina
12
in
a
letter
to
president
menem
in
1994
a
broad
range
of
argentine
journalists
writers
and
officials
had
rallied
in
support
of
pagina
12
including
the
association
for
the
defense
of
independent
journalism
an
independent
press
freedom
group
formed
one
year
ago
to
act
on
behalf
of
threatened
or
harassed
journalists
scores
of
journalists
were

the
anti

penalty
page
welcome
to
the
irish
section
s
anti
death
penalty
page
amnesty
international
opposes
the
death
penalty
in
all
cases
and
without
reservation
the
time
has
come
the
time
has
come
to
abolish
the
death
penalty
world
wide
the
case
for
abolition
becomes
more
compelling
with
each
passing
year
nowhere
has
it
been
shown
that
the
death
penalty
has
any
special
power
to
reduce
crime
or
political
violence
in
country
after
country
it
is
used
disproportionately
against
the
poor
and
against
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
it
is
often
used
as
a
tool
of
political
repression
its
use
is
arbitrary
and
irrevocable
it
is
imposed
and
inflicted
arbitrarily
it
is
an
irrevocable
punishment
resulting
inevitably
in
the
execution
of
people
innocent
of
any
crime
it
is
a
violation
of
fundamental
human
rights
whatever
purpose
is
cited
the
idea
that
a
government
can
justify
a
punishment
as
cruel
as
death
conflicts
with
the
very
concept
of
human
rights
the
significance
of
human
rights
is
precisely
that
some
means
may
never
be
used
to
protect
society
because
their
use
violates
the
very
values
which
make
society
worth
protecting
there
are
38
states
in
the
us
which
have
the
death
penalty
along
with
the
us
government
and
the
us
military
as
part
of
the
irish
section
s
fight
against
the
death
penalty
there
are
four
local
groups
working
on
the
state
of
virginia
usa
these
are
group
34
dublin
the
limerick
group
the
schull
group
and
the
cork
group
and
now
for
some
information
on
virginia
and
its
very
strange
laws
virginia
currently
has
57
inmates
on
death
row
it
has
executed
31
inmates
since
1976
five
of
them
in
1995
another
two
have
been
executed
this
year
already
eleven
states
in
the
us
forbid
execution
of
the
mentally
retarded
virginia
is
not
one
of
them
the
methods
of
execution
in
va
are
lethal
injection
or
electrocution
by
choice
with
electrocution
by
default
the
contemporaneous
objection
rule
the
c
o
r
states
that
when
an
objection
is
not
raised
in
the
original
trial
it
cannot
be
considered
in
a
direct
or
later
appeal
every
state
except
virginia
waives
the
c
o
r
in
capital
cases
by
statute
or
by
case
law
this
rule
bars
appeals
courts
from
hearing
about
even
blatant
mistakes
in
the
trial
and
illegal
procedures
that
can
include
jury
selection
jury
instructions
evidence
prevented
or
withheld
witness
testimony
and
any
other
aspect
of
the
trial
these
problems
can
and
do
affect
the
basic
fairness
and
constitutionality
of
the
trial
the
issue
not
objected
to
at
the
first
trial
is
barred
even
if
it
shows
the
innocence
of
a
person
on
death
row
the
21
day
rule
the
21
day
rule
states
that
new
evidence
discovered
more
than
21
days
after
the
trial
cannot
be
considered
in
state
or
federal
courts
even
if
the
evidence
could
prove
the
innocence
of
a
convicted
defendant
the
21
day
rule
has
created
a
situation
where
a
person
can
be
legally
executed
despite
new
evidence
that
he
is
innocent
please
protest
against
this
continued
barbarism

introduction
to
computers
is
an
introductory
course
intended
primarily
for
those
not
planning
to
do
further
work
in
computer
science
the
course
will
focus
on
some
of
the
many
ways
that
one
can
use
a
computer
we
will
study
how
to
use
email
how
to
access
and
post
to
newsgroups
and
other
resources
on
the
internet
our
major
focus
for
this
semester
however
is
to
write
programs
we
will
use
the
scheme
a
dialect
of
the
lisp
programming
language
to
solve
problems
and
accomplish
tasks
another
goal
for
this
course
is
to
make
you
the
user
computer
literate
so
that
you
will
be
familiar
with
the
common
jargon
of
computer
folks
and
have
a
sense
of
the
historical
development
of
computing

they

each

you
repeat

throw

repeat
this

you

fact
throughout

recall
the
description
of
treaps
given

class
briefly
every
element
has
a
key
and
a

they
are
put

they
have
an
inorder

property
with

a
random
treap
is
one
where
the
priorities
have
been
assigned
randomly
for
this
problem
we
ll
just

that
the
prioirities
are
given
by
some
random
permutation
let
x
be
any
element
and
a

let

advanced
operating
systems
summary
this
course
is
intended
to
give
you
a
broad
exposure
to
advanced
operating
systems
topics
we
will
be
reading
about
and
discussing
such
topics
as
protection
security
memory
management
operating
system
kernels
file
systems
synchronization
naming
and
distributed
systems
please
read
the
rest
of
this
information
sheet
carefully
text
there
is
really
no
satisfactory
textbook
for
a
graduate
level
operating
systems
class
so
we
will
use
the
current
literature
as
our
text
the
course
will
be
structured
around
readings
from
journal
articles
and
conference
proceedings
you
will
be
able
to
purchase
these
readings
at
doit
cs736
handout
1
during
each
class
we
will
discuss
topics
relevant
to
the
current
papers
the
lecture
will
not
be
a
detail
by
detail
review
of
the
papers
but
will
instead
be
a
discussion
of
major
topics
and
themes
using
the
papers
a
focal
point
you
will
form
reading
groups
with
2
or
3
of
your
classmates
that
will
meet
once
or
twice
a
week
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
assigned
papers
the
readings
are
an
especially
important
part
of
the
class
we
will
go
through
the
reading
list
according
the
posted
reading
schedule
so
the
formula
for
being
successful
in
this
class
is
1
read
the
papers
independently
2
discuss
them
in
your
reading
group
trying
to
identify
the
important
issues
and
3
participate
in
the
class
discussion
of
the
papers
class
discussions
class
meetings
will
be
in
the
form
of
discussion
lectures
we
will
talk
about
the
day
s
topics
and
this
discussion
will
be
supported
by
your
comments
and
opinions
if
you
are
willing
to
participate
actively
and
daily
in
class
you
ll
get
a
lot
out
of
it
if
you
expect
to
sit
quietly
and
listen
for
15
weeks
you
will
be
very
unhappy
in
this
class
papers
during
this
class
you
will
write
two
papers
one
short
6
pages
and
one
longer
the
first
paper
will
be
a
design
based
on
ideas
that
you
have
read
you
will
work
from
some
well
understood
operating
system
facility
and
design
an
extension
in
some
area
the
second
paper
will
involve
a
project
and
the
paper
will
be
a
summary
of
that
project
there
will
be
a
selection
of
project
topics
from
which
to
choose
writing
well
will
be
as
important
as
writing
about
good
ideas
each
paper
will
be
reviewed
at
least
twice
the
first
reading
will
be
a
refereeing
of
the
paper
by
one
of
your
fellow
students
this
will
give
the
writer
critical
comments
by
another
person
and
give
the
reader
a
look
at
someone
else
s
writing
the
paper
will
then
be
revised
for
a
second
pass
that
will
be
read
by
me
exams
there
will
be
no
exams
the
papers
and
reading
will
keep
you
busy
grades

objective
the
major
focus
of
this
research
is
the
design
testing
and
prototyping
of
a
novel
high
performance
optical
interconnection
network
for
supercomputers
which
is
based
on
optically
communicating
mesh
routers
or
crossbars
and
which
is
scalable
the
geographic
coverage
ranges
from
interdepartmental
to
campus
and
even
to
metropolitan
areas
the
network
provides
very
high
speed
multiple
services
supporting
hybrid
circuit
switched
and
datagram
traffic
and
direct
or
multi
hop
connections
that
are
dynamically
reconfigurable
at
a
first
networking
level
we
locally
interconnect
workstations
supercomputers
peripheral
devices
mass
memory
etc
through
host
interfaces
at
a
higher
networking
level
we
use
fully
optical
interconnects
allowing
communication
between
devices
connected
to
distinct
mesh
routers
a
goal
of
this
research
is
to
capture
the
large
latent
distributed
computational
power
of
the
network
processors
to
be
used
for
network
control
and
management
leading
to
an
intelligent
network
a
main
motivation
for
the
research
stems
from
the
limitations
observed
in
current
supercomputer
interconnect
systems
and
from
the
opportunities
offered
by
emerging
communication
technologies
such
as
wdm
optoelectronics
for
novel
feasible
system
architectures
approach
we
propose
to
overcome
the
usual
interconnect
problems
by
replacing
the
point
to
point
links
with
an
all
optical
interconnect
system
namely
the
high
speed
lans
will
be
connected
to
an
optical
star
or
tree
physical
topology
wavelength
division
multiplexing
wdm
will
be
used
to
subdivide
the
very
large
fiber
bandwidth
into
several
channels
each
of
gbps
bandwidth
wdm
channels
supporting
also
time
division
multiplexing
will
be
established
between
modules
thus
defining
a
dense
virtual
interconnection
topology
which
is
dynamically
reconfigurable
responding
to
changing
traffic
patterns
a
pool
of
channels
will
be
set
aside
for
direct
end
to
end
connections
between
mesh
routers
providing
circuit
switched
service
for
real
time
traffic
applications
the
heart
of
the
distributed
supercomputer
supernet
is
optimic
optical
interconnect
of
myrinet
ic
chips
optimic
is
a
novel
high
performance
network
consisting
of
myricom
asynchronous
pipeline
crossbars
apc
interconnected
by
a
wdm
optical
backbone
it
supports
both
circuit
switched
and
packet
switched
datagram
traffic
it
achieves
virtual
topology
reconfigurable
interconnection
through
an
optical
star
or
tree
and
it
bases
its
networking
operations
on
the
intelligent
fabric
of
the
network
itself
in
optimic
each
network
node
i
e
apc
is
connected
to
local
hosts
to
other
nodes
and
to
multiple
optical
channels
via
an
optical
channel
interface

from
our
dietitians
have
you
come
across
advertising
that
claims
that
the
calcium
from
plant
foods
is
poorly
absorbed
spinach
is
typically
held
up
as
an
example
while
it
is
true
that
we
only
absorb
about
5
of
the
calcium
from
spinach
due
to
its
high
oxalate
content
it
is
incorrect
to
assume
that
this
automatically
applies
to
all
vegetables
in
fact
for
low
oxalate
vegetables
such
as
broccoli
turnip
kale
brussels
sprouts
cauliflower
and
chinese
greens
absorption
is
50
70
compared
to
approximately
32
for

the
agassiz
project
the
primary
goals
of
the
agassiz
project
are
to
study
the
architectural
compiler
and
machine
organizational
issues
for
high
performance
computer
systems
including
both
uniprocessors
and
multiprocessors
that
exploit
medium
grained
and
fine
grained
parallelism
processor
architectural
studies
are
focused
on
concurrent
multi
threaded
architectures
that
allow
both
thread
level
and
instruction
level
speculation
or
so
called
superthreaded
architectures
the
compiler
effort
is
focused
on
developing
an
integrated
compiler
that
supports
both
medium
grained
loop
iteration
level
and
fine
grained
instruction
level
parallelism
with
speculation
locality
enhancement
and
latency
hiding
schemes
the
machine
organizational
work
is
focused
on
high
performance
memory
systems
design
and
on
clustered
distributed

the
current
research
interests
of
faculty
in
the
group
include
algorithm
design
complexity
theory
parallel
computation
graph
theory
and
probabilistic
methods
a
major
focus
of
the
group
is
on
the
design
and
analysis
of
provably
efficient
algorithms
for
solving
fundamental
computational
problems
where
efficiency
can
be
measured
in
terms
of
different
resources
such
as

ontological
mediation
ontological
mediation
this
page
is
under
construction
abstract
an
ontological
mediator
is
an
intelligent
agent
capable
of
facilitating
communication
between
other
agents
who
use
the
same
communication
protocols
but
use
their
common
language
in
different
ways
different
knowlege
agents
employ
different
ontologies
or
ways
of
taxonomizing
and
constraining
their
domains
when
two
agents
are
using
different
ontologies
communication
cannot
occur
unless
the
agents
can
agree
on
the
meaning
of
words
and
phrases
often
they
cannot
or
they
do
not
have
the
capability
to
hold
such
a
conversation
a
mediator
is
actively
involved
in
understanding
the
content
of
the
messages
sent
between
communicating
agents
and
will
use
knowledge
in
its
domain
of
mediation
to
determine
where
conflicts
arise
learn
the
meanings
of
new
words
translate
expressions
appropriately
and
expand
the
ontologies
of
both
communicating
agents
our
research
project
is
exploring
various
issues
in
ontologies
knowledge
sharing
vocabulary
acquisition
and
distributed
databases
and
we
are
building
an
ontological
mediator

is
the

it
s

uses
of
randomness
in
complexity
theory
techniques
involving
randomness
have
played
a
crucial
role
in
complexity
theory
over
the
past
decade
they
have
been
used
to
prove
results
that
seemingly
did
not
call
for
them
such
as
toda
s
theorem
and
the
fact
that
many
np
hard
problems
are
also
np
hard
to
approximate
the
course
will
survey
these
developments
at
the
same
time
putting
them
in
context
by
also
covering
ideas
from
cryptography
interactive
proofs
and
program
checking
that
led
to
them
the
course
is
scheduled
for
tu
thurs
from
10
30
to
12
but
that
could
change
if
many
people
have
conflicts
with
that
prerequisites
solid
knowledge
of

completeness
and

space
space
space
is
an
approach
to
operating
systems
which
uses
multiple
protection
domains
rather
than
a
single
kernel
to
provide
operating
system
services
eliminating
the
monolithic
kernel
allows
the
operating
system
to
be
written
as
a
set
of
cooperating
application
programs
this
has
a
great
impact
on
the
extensibility
and
flexibility
of
the
system
multiple
instances
of
fundamental
paradigms
such
as
threads
and
virtual
memory
can
coexist
since
they
are
implemented
as
applications
code
all
that
is
left
in
what
was
the
operating
system
kernel
is
a
set
of
mechanisms
to
implement
the
protection
domains
in
space
these
mechanisms
can
be
replaced
as
needed
by
the
application
to
provide
a
fundamental
level
of
extensibility
not
available
in
other
adaptive

dr
brian

overview
images
for
automated
gesture
tracking
computational
vision
can
be
thought
of
as
enabling
computers
to
use
visual
information
like
many
problems
in
artificial
intelligence
it
s
something
people
do
so
easily
they
barely
think
about
it
but
a
very
complex
problem
for
a
machine
our
primary
focus
in
the
vision
lab
at
sfu
is
in
understanding
colour
how
are
colours
perceived
how
can
colours
be
reproduced
accurately
on
different
media
in
what
ways
does
colour
help
in
understanding
images
understanding
colour
is
a
much
more
difficult
problem
than
most
people
suspect
often
poor
colour
rendition
results
more
from
our
limited
understanding
of
colour
perception
than
it
does
from
limitations
of
our
colour
producing
devices
we
subscribe
to
a
computational
view
of
colour
namely
that
human
perception
and
use
of
colour
can
be
explored
and
explained
as
computations
the
fundamental
problem
of
colour
is
to
explain
how
we
see
colours
as
relatively
stable
despite
the
fact
that
the
light
reflected
into
our
eyes
from
an
object
varies
dramatically
with
the
light
illuminating
the
object
colour
and
computers
have
become
much
more
intertwined
in
recent
years
as
colour
displays
and
colour
printers
have
become
more
affordable
since
colour
is
a
perceptual
not
a
physical
quality
it
is
crucial
to
have
a
good
model
of
how
we
perceive
colour
in
complex
environments
if
we
are
to
get
predictable
results
from
these
devices
colours
are
difficult
to
reproduce
correctly
but
why
while
we
ve
all
experienced
untrue
colour
while
using
home
video
cameras
or
viewing
prints
from
our
local
photofinisher
now
we
have
colour
printers
frustrating
us
with
colours
that
look
very
little
like
the
nice
colours
we
previewed
on
our
crts
when
the
colour
doesn
t
look
right
it
s
natural
to
feel
that
the
printer
and
monitor
are
not
calibrated
properly
and
of
course
perhaps
they
re
not
but
that
s
not
the
fundamental
problem
the
fundamental
problem
stems
from
the
fact
that
colour
reproduction
simply
is
not
a
matter
of
reproducing
identical
physical
phenomena
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
sound
reproduction
in
which
a
similar
pattern
of
sound
waves
is
recreated
but
rather
a
matter
of
creating
perceptual
equivalences
for
us
to
build
machines
that
reproduce
colours
accurately
or
to
make
effective
use
of
colour
in
robotics
requires
that
we
understand
human
colour
perception
and
the
last
decade
has
produced
many
interesting
new
computational
theories
of
colour
coming
from
both
computer
science
and
psychology
a
central
concern
of
these
theories
is
to
describe
how
colour
depends
or
does
not
depend
on
the
incident
illumination
a
coloured
surface
cannot
be
seen
unless
we
shine
some
light
on
it
but
the
spectrum
of
the
reflected
light
depends
on
the
product
of
the
spectrum
of
the
incident
light
s
spectrum
and
the
surface
s
reflectance
it
s
natural
to
think
of
a
surface
s
colour
as
a
feature
of
the
surface
itself
but
the
spectrum
of
the
light
energy
reaching
the
eye
has
the
two
factors
of
illumination
and
reflectance
confounded
into
one
in
order
to
determine
the
true
surface
properties
the
effect
of
the
illumination
must
be
taken
into
account
colour
correction
results
in
the
upper
left
is
the
image
of
a
scene
taken
under
an
orangish
tungsten
light
which
has
the
effect
of
turning
the
background
overly
green
and
the
whites
a
bit
yellow
in
the
bottom
right
is
the
target
image
of
the
same
scene
but
under
the
standard
illumination
for
which
the
camera
is
calibrated
since
we
cannot
always
control
the
illumination
our
goal
is
to
correct
automatically
the
colours
in
the
input
image
so
that
they
will
look
like
those
in
the
target
image
the
fuzziness
of
the
images
is
due
to
a
high
jpeg
compression
factor
concentrate
on
the
colours
the
top
right
is
a
corrected
image
produced
by
the
standard
grey
world
colour
balancing
algorithm
which
assumes
that
the
average
of
all
the
colours
in
the
scene
is
grey
in
the
bottom
left
is
the
much
better
result
produced
by
our
new
more
sophisticated
algorithm
developed
in
the
vision
lab
as
you
can
see
the
result
of
our
new
algorithm
is
much
closer
to
the
target
image
than
that
produced
by
the
grey
world
algorithm

the

project
s
objectives
are
i
to
provide
infrastructure
the
flux
for
highly
efficient
component
based
systems
with
flexible
degrees
of
inter
component
trust
initially
oriented
to
hardware
enforced
protection
ii
to
provide
transparent
and
flexible
control
of
all
the
resources
used
by
arbitrary
subsystems
and
iii
to
distribute
free
and
usable
versions
of
the
developed
software
we
have
recently
developed
an
entirely
new
kernel
and
os
structure
on
which
future
work
will
be
based
a

how
this

c
jeffery
several
very
high
level
languages
are
now
in
vogue
such
as
perl
tcl
and
java
although
each
has
its
unique
specialties
each
claims
to
be
a
general
purpose
tool
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
general
purpose
they
can
be
compared
by
implementing
a
set
of
benchmark
applications
in
each
language
timing
results
provide
feedback
to
language
implementors
about
neglected
facilities
and
the
implementation
experience
reveals
missing
features
and
obstacles
encountered
when
using
these
languages
as

overview
the
database

for
vision
research
was
designed
as
a
general
scientific
database
system
but
motivated
by
and
intended
for
use
in
model
based
computer
vision
we
provide
a
unified
data
model
a
highly
graphical
user
interface
an
advanced
query
facility
and
an
interactive
laboratory
notebook
the
database
environment
for
vision
research
aids
in
scientific
experimentation
and
promotes
data
sharing
in
the
computer
vision
community
in
devr
entities
are
stored
in
hierarchical
relational
data
structures
the
schema
for
each
entity
contains
a
name
a
set
of
properties
a
set
of
parts
a
set
of

impulse
based
dynamic
simulation
impulse
based
simulation
is
a
new
paradigm
for
the
simulation
of
physical
systems
especially
those
which
are
hard
to
simulate
efficiently
with
traditional
constraint
based
methods
the
key
idea
is
that
all
contact
interactions
between
objects
are
affected
through
collisions
even
a
block
apparently
at
rest
on
a
table
actually
experiences
many
tiny
rapid
collisions
with
the
surface
the
basic
theory
has
been
put
into
practice
with
impulse
a
rigid
body
dynamic
simulator
running
on
hp
and
sgi
platforms
impulse

physical
accuracy
and

have
been
and
continue
to

the
project
is
to
expand

d
interactive
simulations
and
virtual
world
models
to
disk
based
storage
today
virtually
all
such
systems
require
that
the
model
data
fit
in
main
memory
the
project
has
many
aspects
including
the
design
of
appropriate
storage
structures
real
time
delivery
of
model
data
in
response
to
user
actions
inclusion
of
quality
of
service
tradeoffs
into
resource
management
and
many
others
the
applications
to
be
explicitly
addressed
in
the
project
span
a
range
including
urban

topics
the
purpose
of
the
course
is
to
understand
the
nature
of
computation
by
investigating
several
different
models
formal
languages
including
regular
languages
context
173
free
languages
recursive
languages
and
languages
which
can
be
recognized
in
polynomial
time
and
other
tools
will
be
used
to
study
the
comparative
power
of
these
models
there
will
not
be
enough
time
to
cover
the
entire
book
but
we
will
include
some
sections
from
almost
every
chapter
the
central
chapters
are
4
5
and
7
assignments
written
work
mostly
problem
sets
will
be
assigned
weekly
no
late
work
will
be
accepted
except
for
illness
or
similar
reasons
normally
40
of
the
grade
will
be
determined
by
the
work
on
these
assignments
the
effect
on
the
grade
will
be
greater
for
those
who
do
not
turn
in
the
assigned
work
midterms
the
two
midterms
which
together
will
account
for
35
of
the
grade
will
be
on
september

coordination
page
coordination
in
parallel
programs
coordination
refers
to
those
features
of
parallel
programs
involving
multiple
processes
namely
communication
synchronization
and
scheduling
for
simple
programs
with
regular
data
access
patterns
coordination
structures
can
be
determined
at
compile
time
and
require
little
runtime
support
for
applications
with
irregular
data
access
patterns
for
example
loops
that
iterate
over
portions
of
an
array
or
dynamic
data
structures
some
coordination
decisions
are
best
left
until
runtime
necessitating
more
powerful
runtime
support
and
more
sophisticated
compile
time
analysis
in
this
project
coordination
is
provided
by
delirium
a
coordination
language
for
expressing
scheduling
and
communication
patterns
by
adaptive
runtime
scheduling
and
by
multipol
a
distributed
data
structure
library
some
of
the
software
developed
in
this
project
is
being
integrated
with
other
parallel

based
on
participation
and
successful
completion
of
the
weekly
exercises
each
group
will
be
asked
some
general
questions
on
each
experiment
the
intent
is
to
examine
the
students
understanding
of
the
current
experiment
and
if
they
have
developed
an
adequate
understanding
of
the
assembly

is
required
by
each
group
of

expertise
smaller
teams
are
also
acceptable
if
the

of
interest
so
demands
or
if
there
are
difficulties
in

the
seminar
will
be
a
research
oriented
investigation
of
selected
topics
in
the
area
of
distributed
computing
to
illustrate
some
of
the
fundamental
and
most
interesting
aspects
of
recent
research
i
have
chosen
some
problems
and
results
that
are
self
contained
and
have
a
puzzle
like
quality
wait
free
objects
under
certain
conditions
data
structure
operations
can
be
concurrent
and
guarantee
that
no
single
operation
is
ever
blocked
self
stabilization
how
to
write
programs
that
always
correct
themselves
after
external
disruptions
firing
squad
a
number
of
simply
stated
synchronization
problems
have
elegant
solutions
register
constructions
is
it
possible
to
create
atomicity
or
related
notions
from
components
that
themselves
are
not
atomic
interval
routing
for
certain
types
of
networks
routing
tables
can
be
quite
compact
using
graph
theoretic
properties
sorting
networks
actually
not
a
network
in
the
sense
of
the
internet
these
special
purpose
structures
show
how
parallel
sorting
counting
and
load
balancing
can
be
implemented

workload
students
are
expected
to
work
on
some
projects
and

there
will
be
no

we
will
look
at
papers
from

what
you
will
learn
that
lqg
and
kalman
theory
are
history
what
the
new
theory
is
all
about
where
it
s
likely
to
go
and
how
to
use
it
to
design
your
own
regulators
and
observers
who
should
attend
estimation
and
controls
practitioners
who
wish
to
get
much
better
performance
from
their
systems
by
merely
using
better
feedback
gain
matrices
those
interested
in
continuing
the
research
while
the
material
is
heavily
mathematical
the
essential
ideas
in
statistics
power
spectra
and
matrix
algebra
and
calculus
will
all
be
covered
summary
lqg
theory
for
regulators
and
kalman
theory
for
observers
both
require
you
to
believe
that
all
process
and
measurement
noise
is
white
and
gaussian
when
no
physical
noise
has
either
property
further
lqg
theory
forces
you
to
accept
that
minimizing
the
trace
of
a
weighted
covariance
of
the
state
variables
is
what
s
good
for
you
while
kalman
theory
relies
on
minimizing
the
trace
of
the
measurement
error
weighted
residuals
whose
relation
to
engineering
desires
is
tenuous
at
best
this
course
is
designed
to
show
you
how
to
design
optimal
regulators
and
observers
for
stationary
systems
based
on
knowledge
of
the
all
the
noise
power
spectra
and
using
performance
measures
that
are
much
more
sensitive
to
your
actual
engineering
needs
you
will
also
see
that
by
your
own
measure
performance
is
likely
to
be
greatly
improved
relative
to
lqg
or
kalman
derived
feedback
gains
while
several
papers
and
seminars
have
been
given
on
this
subject
this
is
the
first
course
offered
on
how
to
do
it
along
with
the
current
status
of
the
theory
throughout
obscure
matrix
relations
are
introduced
as

caveat
this

that
you
purchase
a

bound
copy
from
the

center
in
the
basement
of

i
tried
printing
this
once
and
it
took
hours
plus
i
had
to
hole
punch
the
hardcopy
myself
that
ate
up
an
afternoon
my
book
was
also
twice
as
bulky
because
i
did
not
want

introduction
and
goals
the
purpose
of
this
three
year
reseach
project
1994
1996
is
to
develop
a
framework
and
systematic
methodology
to
facilitate
the
application
of
multidisciplinary
design
optimization
mdo
to
a
diverse
class
of
system
design
problems
mdo
is
based
upon
the
philosophy
of
identifying
the
appropriate
combination
of
parameters
which
are
under
the
control
of
a
designer
or
design
team
and
which
will
result
in
the
most
effective
product
or
system
for
all
practical
aerospace
systems
the
design
of
a
systems
is
a
complex
sequence
of
events
which
integrates
the
activities
of
a
variety
of
discipline
experts
and
their
associated
tools
the
development
archiving
and
exchange
of
information
between
these
individual
experts
is
central
to
the
design
task
it
is
this
information
which
provides
the
basis
for
these
experts
to
make
their
design
decisions
resulting
in
the
final
product
the
development
of
mdo
has
been
inextricably
tied
to
developments
in
computer
hardware
and
software
advanced
analysis
tools
such
as
computational
fluid
dynamics
cfd
and
finite
element
analysis
fea
have
now
been
integrated
into
the
daily
activities
of
many
designers
however
design
decisions
are
often
based
on
a
variety
of
information
sources
analytic
numerical
simulation
design
heuristic
or
even
intuition
the
development
and
integration
of
this
information
using
high
powered
computing
tools
has
begun
to
demonstrate
the
true
potential
of
mdo
a
variety
of
methods
and
applications
are
being
considered
in
each
case
the
fundamental
approach
is
to
provide
the
individual
discipline
expert
with
the
information
necessary
to
evaluate
the
system
as
a
whole
and
to
be
able
to
understand
the
impact
of
individual
decisions
on
the
overall
system
design
the
methods
being
considered
include
extensions
to
global
sensitivity
equations
gse
the
application
of
artificial
neural
networks
for
design
space
mapping
and
the
integration
of
distributed
computing
and
process
scheduling
into
the
mdo
environment
the
current
research
effort
is
a
joint
program
between
the
departments
of
aerospace
and
mechanical
engineering
and
the
computer
science
and
engineering
departments
at
the
university
of
notre
dame
the
coordination
of
efforts
within
the
project
is
based
upon
identification
of
a
series
of
demonstration
problems
the
formulation
of
a
number
of
mdo
algorithms
and
specific
design
tool
development
test
problem
and
algorithm
development
provide
a
focus
for
the
efforts
of
each
of
these
individual
researchers
these
problems
are
being
selected
so
that
they
represent
a
diverse
spectrum
of
mdo
applications
and
will
present
a
variety
of
challenges
for
the
methods
being
developed
and
evaluated
as
part
of
this
research
program
as
this
three
year
program
continues
information
related
to
each
of
the
primary
phases
of
the
project
will
be
added
to
this
document
the
results
of
those
issues
identified
as
future
efforts
will
be
used
to
assess
applicability
of
the
mdo
tools
to
a
wide
variety
of
applications
a
number
of
references
are
available
which
outline
various
developments
associated
with
this
research
program

summarizes
the
research

summary
carnival
is
a
tool
designed
to
automate
the
process
of
understanding
the
performance
of
parallel
programs
it
supports
performance
measurement
modeling
tuning
and
visualization
carnival
measurements
are
based
on
predicate
profiling
which
quantifies
the
time
spent
in
each
category
of
overhead
during
execution
our
first
implementation
of
predicate
profiling
was
implemented
on
the
ksr
1
we
now
have
implementations
for
the
sgi
challenge
multiprocessor
the
ibm
sp
2
a
network
of
sun
workstations
running
pvm
and
a
cluster
of
alpha
workstations
carnival
is
a
novel
attempt
to
automate
the
cause
and
effect
inference
process
for
performance
phenomena
in
particular
carnival
currently
supports
waiting
time
analysis
an
automatic
inference
process
that
explains
each
source
of
waiting
time
in
terms
of
the
underlying
causes
instead
of
simply
identifying
where
it
occurs
we
are
now
developing
a
similar
technique
to
explain
the
causes
of
communication
our
ultimate
goal
is
to
combine
the
accuracy
of
empirical
performance
measurement
with
the
predictive
power
of
analytic
performance
modeling
towards
that
end
carnival
supports
lost
cycles
analysis
which
uses
a
priori
knowledge
of
the
sources

carnival
combines
empirical
model

techniques
from
statistics
with
measurement
and
modeling
techniques
for

carnival
is
also
a
visualization
tool
that
provides
a

between
performance
measurements
and
the
source
code
the
interface
presents
the
original

in

window
along
the
left

side
of
the
source
is
a
grey

bar
that
indicates
the
amount
of

spent
in
each
portion
of
the

code
summed
across
all
processors
along
the
right
hand
side
of
the
source
code
are
color
bars
that
indicate
the
percent
of

spent
in

again
summed

executive
summary
from
interviews
with
industry
leaders
and
analysis
of
recent
events
it
is
possible
to
connect
some
of
the
dots
and
make
educated
guesses
about
what
1996
holds
in
store
for
wireless
the
way
larry
vanston
sees
it
the
year
ahead
will
be
a
lot
like
95
in
the
world
of
wireless
telecommunications
this
is
to
say
that
1996
will
be
another
year
of
record
setting
growth
heightened
competition
and
rapid
techno
logical
change
for
the
industry
according
to
vanston
president
of
austin
texas
based
consultants
technology
futures
inc
vanston
and
other
observers
surveyed
by
wb
f
said
it
may
well
be
that
the
industry
is
in
for
a
year
when
the
pace
of
developments
if
anything
gains
more
momentum
such
an
acceleration
is
seen
occurring
across
a
broad
front
mani
fested
by
prices
for
services
driven
lower
as
more
competitors
arrive
on
the
scene
and
by
a
stream
of
technological
advances
and
against
a
backdrop
where
wireless
telephony
becomes
a
widespread
reality
in
more
markets
overseas
but
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
no
clouds
on
the
wireless
horizon
indeed
renewed
signs
of
a
slowdown
in
the
u
s
cellular
market
the
world
s
largest
in
terms
of
absolute
subscribers
have
dampened
the
growth
outlook
for
network
operators
and
for
handset
and
infrastructure
manufacturers
as
nokia
corp
noted
dec
14
despite
improvement
in
nokia
s
u
s
mobile
phone
business
growth
and
profitability
in
nokia
mobile
phones
have
developed
somewhat
below
plan
that
sent
the
price
of
nokia
s
american
depositary
receipts
tumbling
for
the
second
time
in
two
months
page

however
it
was
unclear
at
press
time
whether
handset
manufacturers
in
general
faced
a
repeat
of
the
overages
that
built
up
in
their
u
s
inventories
during
the
1994
christmas
season
all
the
same
wall
streeters
are
a
notoriously
fickle
bunch
and
any
fall
off
in
domestic
wireless
growth
should
be
measured
against
the
blistering
ex
pansion
that
the
u
s
market
enjoyed
during
1994
and
the
first
half
of
1995
net
subscriber
additions
simply
could
not
be
sustained
forever
at
such
an
ex
plosive
rate
and
cellular
s
long
term
growth
pattern
seems
firmly
intact
by
the
end
of
1996
it
is
conceivable
that
there
will
be
40
million
cellu
lar
subscribers
in
the
united
states
a
gain
of
10
million
in
a
15
month
span
all
eyes
turn
to
pcs
big
changes
are
destined
to
sweep
the
u
s
wireless
market
this
year
as
the
industry
comes
to
grips
with
the
probable
enactment
of
legislation
aimed
at
deregulating
telecommunications
this
would
give
network
operators
the
statu
tory
certainty
they
need
to
move
forward
with
big
purchases
of
new
equipment
said
matthew
flanagan
president
of
the
telecommunications

association
arlington
va
moreover
the
u
s
market
is
on
the
verge
of
entering
a
new
phase
with
the
advent
of

personal
communications
services
pcs
it
may
be
another
year
yet
before

but
pcs

are
betting
big
bucks
that
both
lower
price
points
and
the
digitally
enhanced
sound
quality
of
calls
placed
over
their

will
prove
appealing
to
consumers
who
have
disdained
cellular
as
too
costly
and
to
at
least
some
cellular

this

challenges

service
competition
consolidation
and

more
of
the

only
more
so
perhaps
the
most
important
issue
before

wireless

is
how
to
compete
effectively
on
a
landscape
that
seemingly
keeps
shifting
beneath
its
feet
for
many
wireless
players
achieving
scale
is
the
way
to
maximize
their
competitive
ability
this
consolidation
trend
has
been
most
pronounced
in
paging
where

fice
it
to

that

in

this

the
introduction

cellular

that
employ

communications
gsm
technology
in

should

long

hard
about

dcs

and

so
says
toni

for
swiss

which
has
deployed
a
dcs

personal

pcn
in
geneva
to
go
with
its
nationwide
gsm
cellular
network
while
its

with

has
been
limited
the
geneva
system
was
rolled
out
to
coincide
with
the

conference
last

the
ptt
plans
to
introduce

stadelmann
told
the
pcs

in
north
america
conference
in
washington
last
month
in
the
long
run
he
said
the
company
hopes
to
reach
roaming
agreements
that
would
tie
its
pcn
service
together
with
europe
s
gsm
cellular
operators
and
countries
that
either
have
pcn
already
the
united
kingdom
germany
and
france
or
are
contemplating
pcn
rollouts
including
sweden
and
italy
but
there
is
one
sizable
problem
wireless
equipment
manufacturers
need
to
speed
up
efforts
to
bring
dual
band
mobile
phones
to
market
the
subject
of
gsm
dcs
1800
handsets
also
came
up
during
another
recent
meeting
in
washington
i
don
t
know
of
any
vendor
today
committed
to
developing
these
handsets
malcolm
cowan
general
manager
of
the
richardson
texas
based
pcs
business
unit
of
northern
telecom
ltd
told
the
pcs
strategies
conference
if
recent
contract
announcements
are
any
indication
however
finland
s
nokia
corp
may
be
the
first
to
take
the
plunge
the
company
has
signed
a
two
year
contract
with
telia
mobitel
the
biggest
gsm
cellular
network
in
sweden
for
the
delivery
of
base
station
subsystems
that
can
be
used
either
for
a
stand
alone
dcs
1800
network
or
a
seamless
dual
band
service
the
base
stations
are
designed
to
bolster
capacity
in
areas
with
heavy
calling
traffic
as
well
as
to
improve
indoor
coverage
savings
on
fixed
and
operating
costs
more
flexibility
in
setting
rates
nokia
s
other
recent
gsm
dcs
1800
infrastructure
deals
were
with
nordictel
holdings
of
sweden
and
sonofon
of
denmark
it
also
was
the
vendor
for
swiss
telecom
s
dcs
1800
system
for
swiss
telecom
scheduled
to
face
competition
in
pcn
beginning
in
1998
when
spectrum
set
aside
for
private
operators
will
be
opened
up
pairing
gsm
and
dcs
1800
will
afford
cost
advantages
in
the
areas
of
infrastructure
its
trans
mission
network
and
customer
service
and
billing
stadelmann
said
according
to
an
analysis
in
which
the
ptt
assigned
different
weightings
to
these
cost
areas
potential
savings
of
30
percent
can
be
had
12
percent
on
both
transmission
network
and
billing
customer
service
expenses
and
another
6
percent
on
infrastructure
costs
moreover
in
limiting
its
pcn
coverage
to
urban
areas
stadelmann
said
that
swiss
telecom
has
found
that
it
can
devise
a
rate
structure
that
offers
greater
appeal
to
the
more
price
conscious
segment
of
the
wire
less
voice
market
by
setting
rates
close
to
those
of
the
wireline
network
swiss
telecom
hopes
to
induce
customers
to
switch
over
to
pcn
from
the
fixed
network
for
the
mobility
it
affords
but
that
of
course
first
would
require
a
more
robust
roaming
capability
all
stadelmann
could
do
last
month
was
ask
rhetorically
what
are
the
manufacturers
doing
he
would
like
to
see
action
sooner
rather
than
later

multiple

on
the
way
at
the
fcc
s
dec
15
open
meeting
chairman
reed
hundt
hailed
the
prospect
of
simultaneous
spectrum
auctions
as
a
tremendous
accomplishment
and
with
good
reason
while
the
specialized
mobile
radio
smr
auction
that
began
a
month
ago
generally
has
moved
along
at
a
more
sedate
pace
the
c
block
auction
of
bandwidth
for
broadband
personal
communications
services
pcs
kicked
off
with
a
bang
on
dec
18
net
high
bids
for
the
493
c
block
licenses
exceeded
1
2
billion
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
round
one
hopeful
puerto
rico
based

2000
l
p
offered
an
astronomical
327
million
in
net
high
bids
for
basic
trading
area
bta
licenses
in
the
first
round
skewing
the
bidding
but
the
hectic
activity
put
to
rest
at
least
some
doubts
about
whether
the
long
delayed
c
block
auction
would
measure
up
to
last
year
s
pcs
auction
of
major
trading
area
licenses
meanwhile
smr
operators
praised
fcc
plans
to
auction
wide
area
licenses
for
10
mhz
in
contiguous
blocks
of
20
60
and
120
channels
in
the
800
mhz
band
also
two
notices
of
proposed
rulemaking
nprms
will
allot
still
more
spectrum
for
use
in
wireless
applications
if
adopted
as
final
rules
by
the
fcc
one
would
open
the
37
38
6
ghz
band
for
point
to
point
microwave
operations
bta
licenses
would
be
auctioned
off
possibly
as
soon
as
a
year
from
now
with
credits
and
installment
plans
accorded
to
small
businesses
that
wish
to
bid
a
provision
would
permit
the
processing
of
pending
license
applications
in
the
38
6
40
ghz
band
the
other
nprm
would
give
hospitals
access
to
vacant
television
channels
in
the
very
and
ultra
high
frequency
bands
doubling
in
many
regions
the
number
of
frequencies
available
for
remote
patient
monitoring
higher
power
levels
also
would
be
allowed
for

there
might

mostly
we
ll
have
hopefully
heated

the
only
difference
between
this
quarter
and
previous
quarters
is
that
we
ll
start
by
reading
the

virtual
prototyping
of
mechanical
assemblies
virtual
prototyping
of
mechanical
assemblies
current
generation
cad
systems
provide
little
support
for
prototyping
mechanical
assemblies
we
are
creating
an
integrated
design
and
simulation
system
to
address
this
problem
fundamental
to
the
effort
is
the
investigation
of
effective
mechanisms
for
allowing
a
designer
to
interact
with
an
assembly
of
parts
in
a
virtual
manner
prior
to
creation
of
any
physical
prototypes
the
designer
will
be
able
to
touch
hold
and
move
models
of
parts
and
assemblies
as
well
as
see
them
in
rendered
views
the
result
will
be
an
environment
in
which
part
interactions
can
be
considered
in
a
more
natural
manner
than
is
possible
with
current
technology
part
interactions
and
articulations
of
high
dof
assemblies
can
be
considered
early
in
the
design
process
assembly
procedures
can
be
evaluated
at
the
time
when
parts
are
designed
without
the
need
to
explicitly
specify
assembly
sequences
or
constraints
even
greater
advantages
will
accrue
in
the
design
of
devices
intended
for
human
use
since
manipulability
can
be
examined
without
the
need
to
fabricate
a
physical
prototype
finally
the
virtual
display
tools
that
are
integral
to
this
project
will
give
designers
a
better
appreciation
for
complex
part
geometry
than
can
be
gained
from
traditional
cad
displays
which
have

cad
systems
for
all
but
the
simplest
of
mechanical
parts
must
be
able
to
provide
the
designer
with
a
clear
sense
of
three
dimensional
object
geometry
usually
this
is
done
with
standard
graphical
rendering
techniques
involving
perspective
shading
and
simple
animation
when
such
tools
are
used
for
assemblies
of
parts
we
often
hear
designers
complain
what
i
really
want
to
do
is
get
my
hands
on
the
parts
and
see
how
they
fit
together
in
fact
what
is
happening
is
that
the
conventional
display
technologies
are
not
providing
the
user
with
sufficient
information
about
the
geometry
and
manipulability
of
the
objects
in
question
a
key
aspect
of
addressing
this
limitation
is
to
augment
visual
rendering
of
geometric
models
with
haptic
interfaces
which
allow
direct
manipulation
of
modeled
objects
such
interfaces
must
include
accurate
anthropomorphic
geometry
and
provide
realistic
force
feedback
if
they
are
to
be
of
real
value
the
sarcos
dextrous
arm
master
represents
arguably
the
most
advanced
force
reflecting
exoskeleton
available
today
the
upper
seven
degree
of
freedom
arm
component
matches
the
redundancy
of
the
human
arm
while
three
degrees
of
freedom
are
provided
to
the
hand
in
total
there
are
10
degrees
of
freedom
and
of
force
reflection
per
master
arm
in
the
hand
there
is
a
two
degree
of
freedom
thumb
a
fixed
forefinger
and
a
one
degree
of
freedom
flexing
index
middle
finger
the
sarcos
dextrous
arm
is
based
on
hydraulic
actuation
which
is
unmatched
for
torque
density
and
bandwidth
for
this
application
the
result
is
a
master
that
is
much
more
compact
and
of
higher
performance
than
would
be
possible
with
electric
motor
drives
the
pictures
above
shows
a
one
third
scale
model
for
a
novel
diesel
engine
with
one
cylinder
two
pistons
and
four
crankshafts
and
represents
of
the
kinds
of
assemblies
that
we
are
working
towards
accommodating
in
a
virtual
prototyping
system
the
engine
involves
complex
and
interrelated
part
motions
that
should
be
well
understood
by
designers
prior
to
committing
to
expensive
fabrication
operations
a
full
function
virtual
prototyping
system
will
let
the
designer
manipulate
individual
parts
to
see
how
the
entire
assembly
moves
virtual
prototyping
furthermore
would
allow
a
designer
to
consider
possible
assembly
sequences
modifying
parts
as
necessary
to
ease
the
assembly
process
finally
a
virtual
prototyping
system
with
a
sufficiently
complete
model
of
the
human
body
could
be
used
to
validate
assembly
operations
for
the
engine
creating
a
user
interface
for
virtual
prototyping
systems
involves
solving
three
largely
independent
problems
visual
rendering
involves
creating
realistic
views
of
a
configuration
of
parts
there
are
two
aspects
to
haptic
rendering
the
first
involves
giving
the
user
a
realistic
sensation
that
he
or
she
is
actually
touching
and
manipulating
physical
objects
the
second
takes
motions
made
by
a
user
and
modifies
the
models
specifying
the
virtual
world
appropriately
contact
and
interference
computations
are
needed
to
determine
part
to
part
and
user
to
part
interactions
in
the
virtual
world
visual
rendering
haptic
rendering
and
contact
and
interference
detection
must
all
exploit
knowledge
about
the
nature
of
mechanical
assemblies
since
general
solutions
are
not
likely
to
be
viable
geometric
modeling
systems
able
to
support
virtual
prototyping
of
mechanical
assemblies
need
capabilities
beyond
those
of
the
typical
cad
cam
system
not
only
must
it
be
possible
to
design
and
render
individual
parts
but
part
interactions
involving
contact
forces
and
torques
must
be
computable
in
real
time
when
a
designer
reaches
out
to
grab
a
virtual
part
the
system
needs
to
know
when
contact
with
the
part
has
been
made
so
that
appropriate
feedback
can
be
generated
once
a
solid
grip
has
been
established
user
feedback
must
reflect
object
inertial
and
gravity
forces
and
assembly
forces
due
to
contact
for
those
assemblies
capable
of
articulation
a
manipulation
of
one
part
of
the
assembly
must
both
cause
the
appropriate
motions
in
other
parts
of
the
assembly
and
reflect
appropriate
sensations
to
the
user
standard
cad
systems
are
unable
to
supply
much
of
the
information
needed
to
support
either
assembly
operations
themselves
or
the
haptic
rendering
required
in
a
virtual

1996
course
information
august
29
1996
cs212
is
an
introductory
course
covering
a
broad
range
of
computer
science
concepts
and
techniques
including
data
abstraction
recursion
program
correctness
generic
functions
object
oriented
programming
pattern
matching
and
languages
and
their
evaluators
we
use
the
dylan
language
an
object
oriented
dynamic
language
developed
at
apple
computer
which
is
well
suited
for
covering
a
broad
range
of
introductory
computer
science
topics
this
is
not
a
course
about
the
dylan
language
it
just
happens
to
be
the
quot
notation
quot
that
we
have
chosen
for
writing
programs
the
major
goals
of
the
course
are
to
teach
students
how
to
think
clearly
about
programs
and
programming
and
to
provide
a
toolbox
of
modern
programming
techniques
that
will
be
applicable
in
any
language
what
course
to
take
students
often
wonder
whether
to
take
cs211
or
cs212
cs211
focuses
on
programming
skills
in
the
object
oriented
language
java
whereas
cs212
provides
exposure
to
a
broad
range
of
computational
and
programming
problems
using
a
number
of
programming
paradigms
including
functional
object
oriented
and
imperative
programming
techniques
if
you
have
a
good
cs
background
or
good
formal
skills
e
g
mathematics
or
physics
you
should
probably
take
cs212
transfers
between
cs211
and
cs212
in
either
direction
are
encouraged
during
the
first
two
weeks
reaching
us
the
best
way
to
reach
the
course
staff
is
by
posting
questions
or
comments
using
the
cs212
web
site
http
www
cs
cornell
edu
info
courses
current
cs212
this
site
contains
all
course
materials
and
runs
a
conote
server
which
allows
students
and
staff
to
post
questions
and
answers
as
quot
annotations
quot
to
the
handouts
and
problem
sets
in
order
to
access
the
web
site
you
will
need
to
request
a
user
id
and
password
for
the
conote
system
to
do
this
simply
go
to
the
cs212
home
page
and
follow
the
instructions
your
user
id
and
password
will
be
created
by
monday
if
you
request
them
this
week
you
can
also
reach
the
course
staff
is
by
sending
email
to
cs212
cs
cornell
edu
but
this
should
not
be
used
for
asking
questions

requirements
students
are
responsible
for
all
material
in
the
assigned
readings
as
well
as
that
covered
in
lectures
and
in

there
will
be
six
problem
sets
two
preliminary
exams
and
a
final
exam
a
schedule
is
given
below
each
problem
set
will
be
a
combination
of
written
exercises
and
a
programming
assignment
course
grades
will
be
based
on
a
combination
of
the
problem
sets
and
exam
scores
the
problem
sets
will
account
for
approximately
one
half
of
the
total
grade
no
late
assignments
will
be
accepted
we
will
generally
grade
assignments
immediately
and
return
them
the
following
class
period
you
should
try
to
complete
the
programming
assignments
early
as
we
will
not
accept
late
work
the
best
use
of
your
time
and
the
machine
s
time
is
to
think
about
the
problems
before
sitting
down
at
the
computer
no
matter
how
many
times
we
say
this
it
takes
a
long
time
to
sink
in
think
about
the
problems
before
sitting
down
at
the
computer
policy
on
joint
work
much
of
the
learning
in
this
course
comes
from
doing
the
programming
problems
you
may
work
jointly
with
one
other
person
on
the
assignments
no
more
than
two
people
should
work
together
however
if
you
work
together
with
someone
you
must
submit
a
single
joint
assignment
with
both
names
on
it
under
no
circumstances
may
you
hand
in
work
done
with
or
by
someone
else
under
your
own
name
if
in
doubt
credit
the
person
s
from
whom
you
got
help
you
would
be
amazed
at
how
easy
it
is
to
tell
when
people
work
together
on
problem
sets
so
please
don
t
make
life
unpleasant
for
all
of
us
by
breaking
these
rules

and
various
colleges
on

is
a
fan
created
set

for
on

when
a
number
of
us
learned
that
the
expansion
formerly
known
as
wetworks
tefka
ww
was
put
on
hold
by
atlas
games
we
decided
to
satisfy
our
need
for
new
cards
ourselves
the
name
was
spawned
from
the
subject
of
a
letter
from
john
nephew
explaining
why
tefka
ww
wasn
t
possible
anyone
have
a
copy
of
that
letter
there
is
a
mailing
list
on
which
we
discuss
the
set
you
can
subscribe
to
it
by
sending
a
message
to
macjordomo

with
an
empty

companies
need
to

allowing
them
to
promote

and
to
fully

effective

process
management
is
crucial
to
the

jon

of
considerable
interest
in
the
design
automation
community
is
the
problem
of
reengineering
or
redesign
of
electronic
circuits
the
basic
problem
is
to
take
a
given
design
and
to
respecify
or
remanufacture
an
electronic
part
board
or
system
the
key
problem
is
that
original
design
information
may
be
missing
or
incomplete
hence
redesign
starts
with
only
partial
knowledge
of
the
target
system
and
must
infer
original
specifications
our
approach
to
this
problem
incorporates
the
use
of
formal
methods
formal
methods
refers
to
the
collection
of
approaches
based
on
mathematical
logic
and
formal
proof
techniques
used
for
the
design
and
analysis
of
hardware
and
software
systems
our
work
includes
the
use
of
a
variety
of
formal
methods
including
automated
reasoning
genetic
algorithms
and
knowledge
based
systems
verification
of
properties
of
digital
systems
principal
investigator
anthony
wojcik
as
systems
become
ever
more
complex
it
becomes
increasingly
important
to
be
able
to
verify
properties
about
systems
clearly
one
property
is
that
the
system
functionally
implements
the
intended
specification
however
there
are
other
properties
of
interest
including
fault
tolerance
and
security
a
critical
problem
is
the
modeling
of
properties
of
systems
and
then
the
verification
of
the
properties
it
is
clear
that
simulation
alone
cannot
be
used
to
verify
properties
for
that
reason
the
use
of
formal
methods
continues
to
be
of
great
importance
formal
methods
refers
to
the
collection
of
approaches
based
on
mathematical
logic
and
formal
proof
techniques
used
for
the
design
and
analysis
of
hardware
and
software
systems
our
work
is
concerned
both
with
the
use
of
appropriate
representations
for
modeling
systems
and
properties
of
systems
and
the
application
of
techniques
incorporating
automated
reasoning
systems
prolog
and
other
approaches
in
order
to
prove
properties
of
systems

principal

reducing
the
amount
of
power
dissipated
by
integrated
circuits
has
become
an
issue
of
major
concern
in
the
design
of
digital
vlsi
systems
among
the
factors
pushing
for
power
efficient
circuits
are
the
tight
energy
budgets
of
portable
computing
and
commu
nication
devices
the
reliability
concerns
of
the
circuits
themselves
and
the
packaging
and
cooling
costs
associated
with
power
hungry
devices
this
project
involves
the
development
of
a
new
placement
approach
in
very
large
scale
integration
vlsi
designs
aimed
at
producing
layouts
of
circuits
with
reduced
power
dissipation
more
specifically
a
placement
methodology
for
digital
vlsi
circuits
is
under
development
whose
objectives
include
minimizing
the
power
dissipation
of
the
resulting
circuit
while
maintaining
the
estimated
wire
length
and
layout
within
pre
established
bounds

among
the

group
s
research
is
a
project
called
numesh
which
effectively
combines
tinkertoy
modularity
with
supercomputer
performance
numesh
describes
a
packaging
and
interconnect
technology
that
supports
high
bandwidth
systolic
communications
on
a
novel
3

four
neighbor
nearest
neighbor
lattice
numesh
modules
simply
plug
together
rather
than
being
connected
by
printed
circuit
traces
or
backplane
buses
numesh
explores
an
engineering
discipline
in
which
physical
location
of
components
are
accounted
for
explicitly
rather
than
being
abstracted
out
of
the
logical
model
simple
engineering
models
are
provided
via
software
tools
instead
of
hardware
generality
much
as
risc
maintains
its
programming
model
through
compilation
rather
than
through
processor
complexity
modularity
of
the
communications
substrate
provides
regularity
in
the
compilation
target
and
allows
iteration
of
a
single
communication
building
block
to
replace
a
variety
of
ad
hoc
communication
paths

research
associate
the
cost
performance
advantages
of
this
approach
stem
from
three
factors
first
physical
component
placement
is
optimized
as
part
of
the
logical
design
secondly
the
underlying
communication
technology
can
be
designed
for
performance
rather
than
interconnect
flexibility
and
thirdly
interconnection
relies
on
mass
produced
modules
not
on
configuration
specific
wiring
numesh
research
embraces
several
technologies
including
architecture
of
the
communications
substrate
clocking
and
communication
technologies
compilers
and
programming
models
and
representative
applications
our
initial
focus
has
been
the
important
class
of
algorithms
whose
static
communication
patterns
can
be
precompiled
into
a
system
of
independent
but
carefully
choreographed
finite
state
machine
descriptions
we
also
are
exploring
the
extension
of
numesh
to
more
general
communication
to
support
dynamic
routing
for
example
on
another
front
the
alewife
project
was
created
to
design
a
scalable
cache
coherent
shared
memory
multiprocessor
in
this
program
several
thousand
vlsi
processors
each
associated
with
a
portion
of
shared
memory
are
interconnected
via
a
multistage
network
unlike
conventional
shared
memory
machines
this
multiprocessor
exploits
locality
of
referencing
at
the
hardware
and
software
levels
to
maximize
available
memory
bandwidth
a
new
distributed
directory
ensures
coherence
of
the
high
speed
caches
each
processor
uses
to
store
both
private
and
shared
data
thus
further
utilizing
locality
research
focuses
on
data
collection
methods
analytical
and
simulation
techniques
for
evaluating
large
scale
parallel
computers
and
designing
and
building
new
interconnection
networks
and
processor
cache
memory
systems
an
important
goal
is
to
couple
the
design
of
algorithms
for
compilers
and
operating
systems
to
their
goal
resultant
impact
on
multiprocessor
performance
address
traces
obtained
using
various
data
collection
techniques
help
evaluate
architectural
choices
this
insight
in
turn
feeds
back
to

galileo
is
a

being
conducted
in
the
computer

group
at
the
university
of

our
project
focuses
on
the
medium
to
long
term
evolution
of
processor
and
system
architectures
with
an
emphasis
on
the
memory
system
specifically
we
are
studying
what
the
relationship
between
the
processor
and
main
memory
will
be
in
future
systems
completely
separate
as
today
or
integrated
and
if
so
to
what
extent
processing
capability
and
bit
storage
may
merge
in
at
least
two
ways
because
of
increasing
off
chip
penalties
in
issuable
instructions
and
or
limited
off
chip
bandwidth
designers
may
place
more
and
more
capacity
on
the
processor
chip
and
module
until
eventually
a
sizable
fraction
of
main
memory
resides
on
chip
represented
by
the
arrow
labeled
mop
in
the
above

a
different
possibility
is
the
migration
of
processor
capability
onto
the
dram

themselves
eventually
obviating
the

project

harold
abelson
class
of
1922
professor
of
computer
science
and
engineering
gerald
sussman
matsushita
professor
of
electrical
engineering
solving
scientific
problems
increasingly
depends
on
high
speed
computation
careful
planning
of
numerically
based
experiments
and
high
level
qualitative
interpretation
of
large
volumes
of
quantitative
data
working
jointly
with
the
artificial
intelligence
ai
laboratory
researchers
within
mit
s
project
on
mathematics
and
computation
are
developing
a
wide
range
of
intelligent
computation
tools
to
help
scientists
and
engineers
understand
mathematical
models
of
physical
processes
some
of
the
project
s
goals
include
efficient
new
algorithms
specialized
hardware
and
smart
programs
that
comprehend
measured
or
numerical
data
much
of
our
work
in
scientific
computation
is
based
on
ai
methods
we
have
used
computer
vision
techniques
for
example
to
create
programs
that
look
at
and
qualitatively
interpret
graphical
results
of
numerical
experiments
other
programs
can
construct
numerical
simulation
systems
of
dynamically
complex
processes
such
as
oscillating
chemical
reactions
and
nonlinear
vibrating
beams
then
automatically
incorporate
them
into
qualitative
analysis
programs
such
programs
can
also
generate
high
level
summary
descriptions
graphically
and
in
english
of
numerical
experiments
similar
to
the
descriptions
that
appear
in
published
scientific
and
engineering
papers
to
support
the
automatic
construction
of
numerical
procedures
we
are
seeking
ways
to
express
numerical
algorithms
in
terms
of
high
order
procedural
abstractions
sophisticated
numerical
routines
thus
can
be
assembled
by
mixing
and
matching
components
from
a
numerical
library
the
large
library
of
routines
we
are
now
assembling
will
contain
symbolic
methods
as
well
as
numeric
ones
our
work
rests
on
the
scheme
dialect
of
lisp
and
the
scheme
programming
environment
which
we
invented
and
continue
to
develop
we
have
joined
with
other
scheme
users
and
developers
to
formally
standardize
this
dialect
through
the
ieee
we
expect
that
our
freely
available
native
code
scheme
compiler
will
offer
performance
comparable
to
that
of
the
best
commercial
lisp
compilers

president

was
his

official
act
towards

s
continued
intolerance
for

freedom
says
kakuna
kerina
program
coordinator
for

campaign
bedie
routinely
imprisoned
journalists
and
banned
private
newspapers
thus
effectively
outlawing

in

since

eacute
di

in

1993
there
has
been
an
increase
in
prosecutions
against
independent
journalists
which
have
resulted
in
sentences
of
up
to
three
years
imprisonment
physical
attacks
on
ivoirien
journalists
have
also
occurred
in

this
group
is
involved
in
issues
of
form
representation
and
discovery
this
relates
specifically
to
the
exploration
and
representation
of
unknown
environments
using
mobile
robots
and
the
representation
and
recognition
of
objects
key
technical
foci
are
the
abstraction
of
shape
models
across
scale
the
relationship
between
signals
and
symbolic
descriptions
some
of
the
problems
we
are
interested
in
include
the
following
how
can
a
moving
observer
such
as
a
robot
recognize
where
it
is
how
can
it
build
but
a
virtual
reality
model
of
its
world
for
use
by
a
human
operator
this
is
important
for
tasks
such
as
remote
inspection
how
can
a
robot
learn
efficiently
about
where
it
is
how
can
a
group
of
robots
collaboate
efficiently
a
typical
prosaic
objective
create
a

we
consider
the
problem
of
locating
a
robot
in
an
initially
unfamiliar
environment
from
visual
input
the
robot
is
not
given
a
map
of
the
environment
but
it
does
have
access
to
a
limited
set
of
training
examples
each
of
which
specifies
the
video
image
observed
when
the
robot
is
at
a
particular
location
and
orientation
such
data
might
be
acquired
using
dead
reckoning
the
first
time
the
robot
entered
an
unfamiliar
region
using
some
simple
mechanism
such
as
sonar
to
avoid
collisions
in
this
paper
we
address
a
specific
variant
of
this
problem
for
experimental
and
expository
purposes
how
to
estimate
a
robot
s
orientation
pan
and
tilt
from
sensor
data
performing
the
requisite
scene
reconstruction
needed
to
construct
a
metric
map
of
the
environment
using
only
video
images
is
difficult
we
avoid
this
by
using
an
approach
in
which
the
robot
learns
to
convert
a
set
of
image
measurements
into
a
representation
of
its
pose
position
and
orientation
this
provides
a
em
local
metric
description
of
the
robot
s
relationship
to
a
portion
of
a
larger
environment
a
large
scale
map
might
then
be
constructed
from
a
collection
of
such
local
maps
in
the
case
of
our
experiment
these
maps
express
the
statistical
relationship
between
the
image
measurements
and
camera
pose
the
conversion
from
visual
data
to
camera
pose
is
implemented
using
multi
layer
neural
network
that
is
trained
using
backpropagation
for
extended
environments
a
separate
network
can
be
trained
for
each
local
region
the
experimental
data
reported
in
this
paper
for
orientation
information

and

the

of
the
technique

the
major
aspects
of
our
proposed
behavioral
architecture
are
as
follows
a
natural
language
lexicon
is
used
to
represent
spatial
information
and
for
defining
task
commands
the
lexicon
is
used
as
a
language
for
internal
communications
and
user
specified
commands
the
task
is
to
go
to
a
location
in
space
either
known
or
determined
by
locating
a
specific
object
an
extension
of
a
formalism
referred
to
as
teleo
reactive

r
programs
nilsson

is
used
for
specifying
behavioral
control
the
extensions
of
this
approach
involve
dealing
with
real
time
resource
limitations

constraints

i
am
not
normally
in
my

problem
solving
exercises
one
of
the
most
important
skills
you
will
learn
in
this
class
is
problem
solving
good
problem
solving
skills
distinguish
a
good
computer
programmer
from
a
bad
one
it
doesn
t
matter
how
familiar
or
skilled
you
are
in
a
particular
programming
language
if
you
do
not
understand
how
to
solve
the
problem
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
write
a
computer
program
for
it
in
any
language
to
help
you
learn
problem
solving
skills
and
techniques
i
will
assign
weekly
problem
solving
exercises
these
will
be
small
but
non
trivial
problems
which
i
will
give
out
each
monday
you
should
look
at
the
problem
and
think
about
it
during
the
week
and
right
down
the
steps
you
would
go
through
to
solve
the
problem
i
e
the
overall
structure
of
your
program
this
is
primarily
an
exercise
in
general
problem
solving
so
you
do
not
have
to
write
any
fortran
code
though
you
may
if
you
want
to
and
have
time
and
your
solution
algorithm
should
not
even
be
dependent
on
a
particular
programming
language
such
as

systematic
approach
to
programming
languages
relationships
among
languages
properties
and
features
of
languages
and
the
computer
environment
necessary
to
use
languages
overview
this
course
provides
an
introduction
to
the
foundations
of
programming
languages
allowing
a
thorough
understanding
of
programming
language
semantics
and
critical
implementation
characteristics
this
provides
the
basis
for
the
best
choice
and
use
of
existing
languages
as
well
as
language
design
interpreters
and
other
language
processing
programs
are
used
throughout
to
present
the
essential
elements
of
programming
languages
in
a
precise
analytic
manner
the
extensive
use
of
interpreters
in
this
course
also
develops
skill
in
meta
linguistic
abstraction
a
powerful
programming
paradigm
to
thoroughly
understand
programming
languages
or
most
any
topic
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
variety
of
models
or
views
at
varying
levels
of
abstraction
in
this
course
we
will
employ
a
range
of
models
from
very
high
level
almost
mathematical
semantics
to
very
low
level
almost
assembly
language
and
emphasize
the
connections
between
levels
scheme
is
used
as
a
meta
programming
language
throughout
the
course
but
this
course
is
about
fundamentals
that
are
the
basis
for
most
programming
languages
not
just
scheme
special
attention
will
be
given
to
modeling
the
semantics
of
the
java
language
via
a
series
of
type
checkers
and
interpreters
a
slide
presentation
available
in
condensed
form
summarizes
these
points
and
others
topics
include
induction
recursion
and
scope
direct
semantics
interpreters
continuation
passing
style
continuation
semantics
interpreter
imperative
form
and
stack
architecture
static
and
dynamic
semantics

object
oriented

be
available
in
any
of
the
three
big
textbook
bookstores
t
i
s
aristotle
s
or
the
i
u
bookstore
but
you
may
get
it
cheaper
if
you
can
find
a
grad
or
undergrad
student
who
s
taken
c311
or
c511
and
is
willing
to
part
with
it
recommended
the
little
schemer
by
friedman
and
felleisen
this
should
also
be
available
in
the
bookstores
and
a
couple
copies
are
on
reserve
in
the
swain
hall
library
the
little
lisper
is
older
but
similar
other
other
materials
may
be
required
through
the
semester
these
materials
will
be
announced
in
class
and
will
be
made
available
through
the
white
rabbit
on
indiana
near
kirkwood
and
will
cost
a
few
dollars
to
cover
copying
costs
syllabus
read
the
indicated
material
for
each
week
before
the
week
begins
you
are
not
expected
to
understand
the
material
on
first
reading
but
having
read
it
once
first
you
will
be
much
better
prepared
for
class
and
discussion
sections
read
the
material
for
the
first
two
weeks
in
the
first
week
much
of
it
should
be
review
more
material
on

will
be
made

computer

research
group
in
the
department
of
computer
science
at
the
university
of
massachusetts
unlike
traditional
data
networks
future
broadband
isdn
bisdn
wide
area
networks
will
be
required
to
carry
a
broad
range
of
traffic
classes
ranging
from
bursty
variable
rate
sources
such
as
voice
and
variable
rate
coded
video
to
smooth
constant
bit
rate
sources
moreover
these
networks
will
have
to
do
so
while
providing
a
guaranteed
performance
or
quality
of
service
qos
to
these
traffic
classes
the
problem
of
characterizing
performance
in
such
networks
is
thus
particularly
important
since
this
must
be
done
not
only
for
the
traditional
off
line
tasks
of
dimensioning
and
design
e
g
determining
link
bandwidths
buffer
capacities
and
processing
capacities
at
network
switchpoints
but
also
for
on
line
performance
driven
traffic
control
purposes
such
as
session
level
admission
control
in
this
section
we
outline
our
research
aimed
at
providing
the
analytical
tools
and
techniques
for
analyzing
such
networks
and
their
diverse
workloads
and
for
designing
and
characterizing
the
properties
of
scheduling
policies
in
these
networks
traditional
approaches
towards
performance
evaluation
of
communication
networks
are
generally
not
applicable
in
a
high
speed
network
environment
for
a
number
of
reasons
first
the
traffic
in
future
high
speed
networks
is
projected
to
be
bursty
often
processing
complex
correlations
in
the
cell
arrival
processes
simple
markovian
assumptions
such
as
memoryless
inter
arrival
times
are
thus
likely
to
be
invalid
in
such
networks
the
gigabit
rates
of
future
high
speed
networks
also
render
simulation
ineffective
for
systems
of
any
realistic
size
the
very
performance
metric
s
of
interest
in
a
high
speed
network
will
also
be
different
average
delay
will
no
longer
be
the
primary
performance
measure
and
instead
secondary
performance
measures
such
as
probability
of
buffer
overflow
maximum
packet
delay
and
the
tail
of
delay
distributions
must
be
considered
in
this
respect
there
is
evidence
that
even
relatively
sophisticated
performance
models
which
work
well
for
predicting
average
delay
in
the
presence
of
correlated
arrivals
may
be
less
well
suited
for
computing
these
new
performance
measures
of
interest
naga91
we
also
note
that
many
previous
performance
evaluation
techniques
have
been
confined
to
studying
the
performance
of
the
aggregate
traffic
generated
by
a
set
of
identical
sources
at
a
single
multiplexer
in
isolation
in
connection
oriented
high
speed
networks
with
qos
guarantees
it
is
clear
that
performance
must
be
examined
on
a
per
session
basis
and
in
a
network
setting
kuro92
schu92
finally
we
note
that
given
the
potentially
complex
nature
of
network
traffic
it
is
becoming
increasingly
valuable
to
be
able
to
broadly
characterize
properties
such
as
optimality
or
near
optimality
of
network
control
mechanisms
which
hold
over
a
wide
range
of
traffic
models
and
assumptions
thus
far
however
little
work
has
been
reported
on
this
problem
for
traditional
networks
much
less
for
high
speed
networks
given
the
above
considerations
it
is
evident
that
new
performance
evaluation
techniques
will
be
required
for
the
design
and
analysis
future
high
speed
networks
furthermore
given
the
qos
requirements
of
such
emerging
standards
as
atm
these
techniques
will
also
be
needed
for
on
line
performance
driven
traffic
control
purposes
such
as
session
level
admission
control
our
research
in
these
areas
is
aimed
at
addressing
this
need
our
research
divides
broadly
into
four
areas
we
are
developing
a
methodology
for
obtaining
tight
pessimistic
bounds
on
the
per
session
performance
of
a
collection
of
heterogeneous
sessions
within
a
high
speed
network
kuro92
the
metrics
of
interest
are
the
distribution
of
the
packet
delay
and
the
probability
of
buffer
overflow
our
research
is
unique
in
that
we
are
interested
in
computing
provable
performance
bounds
and
in
doing
so
on
a
per
session
basis
in
a
very
general
network
setting
in
which
sessions
may
traverse
a
number
of
hops
this
methodology
is
useful
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
analyzing
session
and
network
level
performance
but
also
as
a
mechanism
to
be
used
for
call
admission
where
performance
qos
guarantees
are
to
be
provided
we
conjecture
that
the
bounds
computed
using
the
above
methodology
may
sometimes
be
too
loose
to
be
of
practical
interest
in
these
cases
it
will
be
of
interest
to
compute
performance
albeit
in
an
approximate
manner
once
again
in
a
network
setting
we
have
thus
also
examined
a
number
of
approximate
approaches
towards
evaluating
the
performance
of
heterogeneous
sessions
within
a
high
speed
network
schu91
naga91
schu92
the
primary
performance
metric
of
interest
is
probability
of
buffer
overflow
our
research
here
is
noteworthy
in
considering
heterogeneous
sources
and
in
doing
so
in
a
network
setting
we
have
developed
a
methodology
for
designing
and
analyzing
the
qualitative
behavior
of
scheduling
policies
this
is
based
on
sample
path
analysis
and
the
theory
of
majorization
tows90
our
focus
is
on
a
wide
class
of
performance
metrics
including
the
average
and
maximum
packet
delay
the
probability
of
buffer
overflow
and
the
length
of
a
buffer
overflow
burst
as
discussed
above
this
work
is
of
particular
interest
and
value
in
that
it
can
characterize
properties
of
scheduling
mechanisms
such
as
their
optimality
or
near
optimality
over
a
wide
range
of
assumptions
thus
obviating
the
need
for
a
potentially
time
consuming
and
or
difficult
case
by
case
performance
analysis
we
are
also
developing
routing
policies
for
high
speed
networks
hwan91
hwan92
given
the
need
to
provide
qos
guarantees
to
admitted
sessions
and
thus
implicitly
reserve
resources
for
on
going
calls
the
routing
problem
in
high
speed
networks
shares
much
more
in
common
with
circuit
switched
routing
algorithms
than
with
routing
in
traditional
data
communication
networks
our
research
in
hwan92
hwan92a
is
aimed
at
exploiting
the
similarities
with
routing
in
traditional
circuit
switched
networks
and
adapting
these
policies
for
the
case
of
high
speed
atm
networks
of
particular
interest
is
the
fact
that
atm
routing
will
be
more
processing
intensive
hwan92
and
will
be
required
to
route
traffic
with
heterogeneous
bandwidth
requirements

i
said
before
in

my

the
purpose
of

is
to
give

however
the

should
be
left

that
becomes

it
should
become
a

that
is

sorry
about
that
it

30
am
as
we
say
in
the
project
description
we
are
dealing
with
sets
so
we
do
not
keep
multiple
copies
of
the
same
word
in
the
same
set
also
the
input
is
error
free
but
one
might
try
to
insert
a
word
in
a
set
that
is
already
there
or
delete
a
word
that
is
not
in
a
set
in
the
first
case
you
must
not
insert
the
word
and
the
count
needs
to
remain
unchanged
in
the
second
case
the
count
must
remain
unchanged
and
nothing
must
be
deleted
note
that
this
is
important
to
facilitate
testing
if
you
implement
insert
as
in
the
class
notes
you
will
have
to
make
to
passes
over
the
trie
in
some
cases
either
to
update
the
count
when
inserting
a
new
word
or
unupdating
the
count
if
it
was
updated
incorrectly
because
the
word
was
already
there
you
can
create
a
member
function
whoami
defined
like
getnext
to
return
the
type
of
object
you
have
for
derived
classes
like
tinytrienode
etc
october

pm
remember
that
the
final
type
of
a
node
depends
on
the
number
of
words
in
that
subtree
it
does
not
depend
on
the
number
of
nodes
or
the
number
of

in

not
intended
for
clinical
use
and
requires
a
pc
connection
to
function
the
user
is
provided
with
a
disk
containing
the
aesop
system
software
a
file
transfer
program
and
a
library
of
movement
and
data
collection
routines
to
use
the
system
aesop
is
connected
to
the
pc
through
the
serial
port
the
file
transfer
software
is
loaded
on
the
pc
and
the
system
software
can
then
be
loaded
through
the
serial
port
once
this
is
done
the
system
can
be
used
within
the
standard
aesop
command
modes
e
g
using
the
foot
and
hand
controls
manual
mode
and
memory
positions
the
user
can
also
send
and
receive
additional
data
from
the
pc
through
the
serial
port
research
applications
with
the
serial
port
users
can
send
data
to
and
receive
data
from
the
aesop
system
a
library
of
commands
is
provided
on
a
floppy
disk
for
example
the
robot
s
individual
joints
can
be
commanded
to
move
to
specific
locations
the
system
can
send
back
information
about
joint
positions
and
movement
histories
in
addition
other
interfaces
may
be
used
to
control
the
robot
for
example
the
robot
could
be
moved
through
voice

reflexology
a
step

by

reflexology
a
step
in
the
right
direction
by
yvette
eastman
reflexology
is
an
ancient
skill
that
uses
a
compression
technique
on
the
feet
that
influences
the
entire
body
our
aim
as
reflexologists
is
to
understand
the
language
of
the
feet
and
to
interpret
it
so
that
we
can
evaluate
the
body
s
vitality
improve
ill
health
and
maintain
stamina
and
vigour
to
the
reflexologist
the
foot
is
the
map
of
the
body
which
he
she
learns
to
read
as
easily
as
a
book
the
key
to
the
foot
reading
is
that
we
carry
all
of
our
unfinished
business
engraved
on
our
body
the
body
remembers
physical
imbalance
emotional
trauma
spirit
experience
and
everything
that
created
an
imbalance
yet
was
never
resolved
it
stamps
it
on
the
foot
the
reflexologist
can
identify
many
of
these
imbalances
and
their
effect
on
the
body
by
merely
looking
at
the
foot
its
shape
will
speak
of
the
structure
of
the
spine
of
the
flexibility
of
muscles
and
joints
lines
on
the
foot
will
identify
congestion
in
different
organs
lungs
stomach
intestines
etc
even
callouses
describe
structural
functions
we
can
even
differentiate
between
chronic
acute
and
old
injuries
to
the
system
once
we
initiate
our
compression
technique
on
the
feet
we
begin
to
understand
the
body
we
use
this
information
to
formulate
the
session
with
the
individual
you
will
find
that
each
session
is
unique
as
your
body
improves
regaining
proper
circulation
elimination
and
a
comfortable
and
energizing
sense
of
relaxation
you
will
require
a
different
type
of
session
to
maintain
this
exquisite
sense
of
well
being
even
when
well
many
people
continue
getting
their
feet
done
it
becomes
a
tune
up
a
method
of
health
maintenance
protection
against
ill
health
prevention
of
disease
costs
less
than
correction
as
more
people
learn
reflexology
and
experience
its
benefits
it
is
slowly
becoming
more
acceptable
therefore
receiving
the
recognition
it
deserves

lcs
supercomputing
technologies
or
supertech
is
a
vertically
integrated
alliance
of
several
lcs
groups
supertech
s
goal
is
to
master
all
aspects
of
high
performance
computing
including
parallel
and
distributed
processing
so
that
modern
hardware
technology
can
be
translated
into
efficient
easy
to
use
computing
systems
organized
as
a
cross
section
of
lcs
supertech
represents
a
cooperative
effort
designed
to
address
the
problems
of
multiscale
computing
to
achieve
our
mission
we
are
studying
machine
architecture
language
design
parallel
computing
theory
numerical
analysis
operating
system
design
and
computational
science
facilities
include
a
128
node
connection
machine
cm
5
parallel
supercomputer
several
silicon
graphics
high
performance
graphics
workstations
and
networks
of
workstations
supertech
is
driven
in
part
by
the
fact
that
today
s
computer
architect
can
select
from
a
range
of
technology
options
including
cost
performance
reliability
and
power
the
variety
of
options
will
grow
even
larger
within
the
next
decade
with
the
introduction
of
gigabit
networks
lightweight
batteries
multichip
modules
and
optical
switches
as
a
result
we
will
soon
see
a
diverse
set
of
multiscale
computing
environments
including
wireless
computers
high
performance
pcs
multiprocessor
workstations
clusters
of
distributed
workstations
local
area
supercomputers
and
massively
parallel
supercomputers
that
cover
a
wide
range
of
performance
parameters
this
vision
of
multiscale
computing
unfortunately
conflicts
with
an
even
more
powerful
force
software
inertia
existing
software
systems
threaten
multiscale
computing
since
they
sanction
only
a
few
well
established
computing
environments
each
new
environment
will
require
massive
custom
programming
to
retrofit
the
standard
software
in
its
attempts
to
unify
multiscale
computing
as
users
will
surely
demand
through
common
languages
operating
systems
network
protocols
and
applications
we
cope
with
these
limitations
via
common
architectural
and
software
mechanisms
designed
to
unify
the
diverse
multiscale
computing
environments
and
encourage
niche
markets
to
flourish
this
task
requires
hardware
and
software
design
the
formulation
of
theoretical
foundations
and
applications
development
supertech
cooperates
closely
with
project
scout
an
lcs
led
consortium
designed
to
promote
interaction
between
computer
and
computational
scientists
scout
members
include
interdisciplinary
scientists
from
mit
boston
university
and
harvard
mit
participants
include
scientists
engineers
and
mathematicians
from
the
departments
of
physics
electrical
engineering
and

science
mathematics
and
earth

sciences
it
is
under

supplement
the
text
rough
course
outline
the
actual
list
of
topics
may
vary
slightly
from
the
list
that
follows
below
depending
on
the
interests
of
the
class
for
instance
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
include
more
material
about
the
relationship
between
finite
model
theory
and
complexity
theory
if
there
is
sufficient
interest
this
course
covers
the
field
of
computational
complexity
theory
beginning
with
the
fundamental
theorems
that
delimit
what
one
can
expect
of
such
a
theory
we
will
also
study
the
diagonalization
techniques
that
continue
to
be
among
the
most
powerful
tools
in
complexity
theory

the
notions
that
have
the
most

importance
in
classifying
the
complexity
of
problems
are
complexity
classes
and

systems
the
concepts
discussed
are
applicable
to
a
variety
of
systems
however
we
will
discuss
many
examples
that
are
drawn
from
historically
significant
and
modern
operating
systems
including
multics

and
windows
nt
topics
to
be
discussed
include
processes

your
decision
relating

all
the

will
be

you
should
be
prepared
to
spend
substantial
amount
of
time
on
the
readings
and
on

there
will
also
be
several
homework

40
from
my
experience
in
teaching
software
courses
in
the
past
most
people
do
very
well
on
programming
projects
so
exams
and
homeworks
end
up
being
the
distinguishing
factors
that
determine
the
grade
for
most
students
on
the
other
hand
doing
poorly
on
the
programming
projects
is
a
sure
way
to
fail
the
course
also
note
that
your
grade
is
only
determining
your
performance
during
the
term
it
is
not
determining
your
future
potential
how
well
you
will
be
able
to
apply
the
course
in
your
employment
etc
and
in
the
end
how
well
you
do
in
the
future
is
what
really
matters
so
it
is
important
to
not
lose
sight
of
the
bigger
picture
beyond
grades
instead
simply
focus
on
doing
the
course
to
the
best
of
your
potential
and
making
sure
to
take
advantage
of
tas
any
myself
to
learn
the
material
many
employers
treat
the
knowledge
of
the
material
in
the
course
as
being
a
true
test
of
an
experienced
software
practioner
policy
on
collaboration
unethical
behavior
such
as
copying
modifying
someone
else
s
project
assignment
code
looking
into
other
students
directories
for
material
when
they
do
not
expect
you
to
copying
homeworks
etc
is
not
permissible
on
the
other
hand
you
are
encouraged
to
discuss
homework
problems
and
project
assignments
with
each
other
that
fosters
learning
and
most
of
the
work
in
computer
industry
is
done
as
a
team
effort
in
such
a
case
please
write
the
names
of
the
students
you
discussed
homeworks
or
projects
on
your
submissions
however
note
that
the
homework
solutions
or
actual
code
must
not
be
shared
homeworks
must
be
written
individually
and
any
code
submitted
must
be
yours
unless
instructor
s
permission
is
taken
and
the

acknowledged

enrollment
policy
csc
517
is
always
one
of
the
most
popular
courses
in
the
graduate
program
because
it
is
a
video
course
it
needs
to
meet
in
one
of
the
college
of
engineering
studios
the
largest
studio
holds
60
students
therefore
we
can
accommodate
only
60
on
campus
students
since
several
students
drop
the
course
during
the
semester
we
have
increased
the
enrollment
limit
for
csc
517
to
80
this
means
that
not
all
students
will
fit
in
the
studio
consequently
lectures
during
the
first
month
of
the
course
will
also
be
shown
in
an
oveflow
room
which
unfortunately
does
not
have
a
two
way
audio
video
link
with
the
studio
thus
students
watching
from
that
room
will
not
be
able
to
ask
questions
seats
in
the
studio
will
be
allocated
on
an
fcfs
basis
students
may
also
watch
the
lectures
via
videotape
in
the
media
center
of
the
d
h
hill
library
between
the
hours
of
8
am
10
pm
m
f
and
1
pm
10
pm
on
sunday
after
the
first
month
attendance
at
lectures
typically
drops
enough
so
that
the
overflow
room
is
no
longer
necessary
all
remaining
students
will
be
able
to
watch
all
lectures
live
if
the
course
fills
despite
the
increase
in
the
enrollment
limit
we
regret
that
we
will
not
have
the
resources
in
classrooms

support

accommodate

mirage
development
team
mirage
is
a
distributed
shared
memory
dsm
system
which
provides
memory
management
and
communication
across
machines
in
a
loosely
coupled
network
environment
the
system
hides
network
boundaries
to
processes
accessing
shared
memory
providing
the
illusion
of
a
coarse
grained
multiprocessor
to
the
programmer
and
algorithm
designer
mirage
is
designed
to
execute
traditional
system
v
posix
compliant
shared
memory
programs
on
commodity
personal
computers
a
key
feature
in
mirage
is
the
simplicity
with
which
powerful
networking
can
be
employed
using
solutions
that
have
been
designed
for
uniprocessors
and
applied
to
a
more
powerful
network
of
workstations
platform
mirage
implements
dsm
using
a
paged
segmentation
scheme
where
segments
are
partitioned
into
pages
the
system
runs
on
a
cluster
of
ibm
ps
2
class
machines
our
lastest
work
in
the
dsm
area
is
a
non
kernel
invasive
dsm
system
based
on
the
quarks
prototype
from
utah
we
are
focusing
on
disconnected
operation
and
mobility
for
distributed
memory
shared
systems
the
new
research
is
based
on
advances
and
experiences
with
mirage
we
have
also
constructed
the
riverside
mobile
dsm
suite
which
are
a
set
of
application
programs
that
exercise
functionality
in
mobile
systems
that
one
would
expect
to
want
to
implement
using
dsm
in
addition
our
group
also
authored
the
dsm
port
of
quarks
to
the
dec
alpha
axp
150
personal
computers
and
made
the
results
of
the
port
accessible
to
other
researchers

jerome

saltzer
professor
of
computer
science
and
engineering
library
2000
is
a
research
project
that
is
exploring
the
system
engineering
of
future
on
line
libraries
the
project
s
approach
is
pragmatic
to
develop
build
and
prime
with
data
a
prototype
testbed
of
an
on
line
electronic
library
using
the
technology
and
system
configurations
expected
to
be
economically
feasible
in
the
year
2000
the
initial
data
is
the
accumulated
collection
of
m
i
t
computer
science
technical
reports
in
the
form
of
scanned
images
our
basic
hypothesis
is
that
the
technology
of
on
line
storage
display
and
communications
will
soon
make
it
economically
possible
to
place
the
entire
contents
of
any
library
on
line
and
make
them
accessible
from
computer
workstations
located
anywhere
our
vision
is
that
one
will
be
able
to
browse
any
book
journal
paper
thesis
or
report
using
an
ordinary
personal
computer
and
follow
citations
by
pointing
the
report
or
paper
selected
should
pop
up
immediately
in
an
adjacent
window
our
goal
is
not
to
invent
or
develop
any
of
these
evolving
technologies
but
rather
to
work
out
how
to
harness
them
the
engineering
and
deployment
of
large
scale
systems
is
always
accompanied
by
traps
and
surprises
beyond
those
apparent
in
the
component
technologies
typical
research
topics
include
discovering
wanted
items
robustly
linking
to
information
across
the
network
and
making
on
line
information
endure
reliably
for
decades

overview
traditional
multicast
routing
mechanisms
e
g
dvmrp
and
mospf
were
intended
for
use
within
regions
where
groups
are
widely
represented
or
bandwidth
is
universally
plentiful
when
group
members
and
senders
to
those
group
members
are
distributed
sparsely
across
a
wide
area
these
schemes
are
not
efficient
data
packets
or
membership
report
information
are
periodically
sent
over
many
links
that
do
not
lead
to
receivers
or
senders
respectively
this
characteristic
lead
the
internet
community
to
investigate
multicast
routing
architectures
that
efficiently
establish
distribution
trees
across
wide
area
internets
where
many
groups
are
sparsely
represented
and
where
bandwidth
is
not
uniformly
plentiful
due
to
the
distances
and
multiple
administrations
traversed
efficiency
is
evaluated
in
terms
of
the
state
control
message
processing
and
data
packet
processing
required
across
the
entire
network
in
order
to
deliver
data
packets
to
the
members
of
the
group
the
protocol
independent
multicast
sparse
mode
pim
sm
architecture
maintains
the
traditional
ip
multicast
service
model
of
receiver
initiated
membership
uses
explicit
joins
that
propagate
hop
by
hop
from
members
directly
connected
routers
toward
the
distribution
tree
builds
a
shared
multicast
distribution
tree
centered
at
a
rendezvous
point
and
then
builds
source
specific
trees
for
those
sources
whose
data
traffic
warrants
it
is
not
dependent
on
a
specific
unicast
routing
protocol
and
uses
soft
state
mechanisms
to
adapt
to
underlying
network
conditions
and
group
dynamics
the
robustness
flexibility
and
scaling
properties
of
this
architecture
make
it
well
suited

research

research
on
ubiquitous
telepresence
ut
project
statement
the
main
idea
of
ubiquitous
telepresence
ut
is
to
allow
users
to
project
their
physical
presence
anywhere
on
the
internet
specifically
users
are
given
the
ability
to
explore
and
interact
with
many
remote
physical
environments
e
g
all
sites
on
the
internet
through
remote
sensing
and
manipulation
devices
the
plan
for
implementing
ubiquitous
telepresence
is
to
build
robotic
or
remote
controlled
units
which
we
have
called
ubots
at
such
low
cost
that
they
become
as
ubiquitous

isaac
the
goal
of
the
isaac
project
is
is
to
unify
methodologies
based
on
existing
technology
and
develop
a
system
for
simulating
virtual
microcosms
populated
with
autonomous
robots
the
principal
focus
is
to
lay
down
the
foundation
that
unifies
eight
major
components
geometric
modeling
model
driven
dynamics
simulation
collision
detection
and
contact
analysis
motion
control
sensory
feedback
knowledge
representation
about
the
environment
incremental
planning
and
a
load
balancing
multi
processor
computational
model
the
primary
investigator
for
isaac
is
james
cremer
my
work
is
centered
on
building
the
dynamics
simulation
engine
for
isaac
and
unifying
all
the
components
into
one
usable
system
the
interactive
time
constraints
of
the
isaac
project
necessitate
highly
efficient
model
representations
fast
linear
algebra
methods
fast
stable
dae
solvers
and
distribution
of
the
simulation
across
processes
and
machines
you
can
find
some
papers
i
ve
written
about
isaac
here
and
here
is

advertisement

you

download
it

i
ve
just
started
playing

this
allows

i

the
primary
purpose
of

allows

the
term
project
will
be
to
write
a
paper
that
surveys
an
area
within
computer
architecture
the
paper
should
summarize
work
in
an
area
giving
extensive
references

at
least
present
opinions
of
others
for
or
against
various
options
again
with

conclude
with
your
opinion
of
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
the
arguments
given
you
will
be
graded
on
the
completeness
of
your
survey
the
accuracy
of
your
summaries
and
the
support
you
give
for
your

research
focuses
on
information
extraction
which
involves
recognizing
and
extracting
specific

we
have
developed
the
autoslog

system
that
generates
dictionaries
of

automatically
using
an
annotated
corpus
we
are
currently
working
with
a
new
version

ts
that
does
not
require
text
annotations

simply

our
approach
to

classification
an
underlying
information
extraction
system
to
recognize
linguisic
context
in
order
to
achieve
high
precision
we
have
developed
several
algorithms
for
text
classification
including
the

information
science
wearable
computing
research
group
the
university
of
oregon
is
actively
involved
in
the
field
of
wearable
computing
we
are
funded
under
a
grant
by
nsf
to
pursue
several
concepts
related
to
the
wearable
field
our
research
goal
is
to
gain
an
understanding
of
the
technical
and
user
interface
issues
of
wearable
computing
more
concretely
our
research
can
be
categorized
into
the
following
broad
areas
developing
wearable
applications
for
fielding
the
most
current
effort
is
the
netman
project
a
virtual
aide
to
installing
computer
lans
there
is
also
work
being
done
with
the
us
army
and
the
marine
corps
to
develop
systems
for
their
use
in
the
near
future
evaluating
wearable
applications
under
development
in
a
number
of
areas
the
goal
of
this
effort
is
to
extract
the
common
features
of
the
systems
this
information
will
be
used
later
in
our
development
of
a
common
software
system
for
wearable
computers
designing
a
common
software
backplane
that
can
rapidly
be
reconfigured
to
perform
a
variety
of
tasks
we
are
attemtpting
to
develop
a
commercially
acceptable
system
that
will
support
the
hardware
being
developed
by
a
variety
of
vendors
in
many
applications
our
first
result
is
a
software
framework
which
we
call
functionality
on
demand
for
more
details
check
the
achilles
project
home
page
our
library
of
software
tools
continues
to
grow
as
we
study
more
applications
tackling
the
theoretical
problem
of
the
limitations
of
a
wearable
system
communications
throughput
processing
speed
and
organization
of
data
are
three
obvious
limitations
of
any
wearable
application
what
expectations
can
we
have
about
systems
that
are
designed
today
with
the
internet
in
its
current
state
versus
a
wearable
system
in
the
next
five
years
this
is
a
highly
fascinating
topic
being
pursued
by
one
of
our
phd
students

envy
envy
envy
is
a
design
for
a
large
solid
state
storage
system
built
primarily
with
flash
memory
its
main
goal
is
to
provide
extremely
fast
and
reliable
access
to
persistent
data
the
obvious
applications
that
can
benefit
from
such
a
system
are
databases
since
their
performance
is
usually
bound
by
the
time
it
takes
to
retrieve
and
modify
data
while
all
databases
can
obtain
significant
benefits
when
using
envy
object
oriented
databases
are
especially
well
suited
since
the
fast
access
time
of
solid
state
storage
effectively
eliminates
the
penalties
caused
by
difficulties
in
optimizing
for
sequential
disk
access
in
current
systems
in
the
envy
storage
system
data
is
stored
permanently
in
solid
state
flash
memory
as
opposed
to
traditional
systems
where
data
is
stored
on
disk
and
reads
are
sped
up
by
a
volatile
dram
cache
flash
technology
s
inherent
non
volatility
allows
envy
to
serve
as
a
permanent
data
repository
rather
than
a
volatile
cache
flash
s
simple
structure
offers
a
cost
advantage
over
all
other
forms
of
solid
state
memory
while
this
still
doesn
t
allow
flash
to
compete
with
magnetic
disks
in
terms
of
cost
per
bit
in
the
near
future
it
does
provide
a
solid
state
storage
alternative
that
can
be
used
for
performance
enhancement
when
disks
are
too
slow
envy
differs
from
other
flash
products
in
that
its
storage
is
memory
mapped
memory
mapping
allows
much
more
efficient
fine
grained
access
than
a
disk
interface
but
is
made
difficult
by
three
basic
problems
with
flash
memory
inability
to
update
in
place
relatively
large
write
latencies
and
limited
erasure
cycling
envy
overcomes
the
update
problem
by
using
page
mapping
to
implement
a
copy
on
write
scheme
with
a
small
amount
of
battery
backed
sram
to
make
updates
appear
to
be
done
in
place
even
though
they
actually
are
not
the
copy
on
write
function
also
almost
entirely
hides
the
flash
write
latency
wide
busses
provide

analyze
3
d
objects
in

is
becoming
increasingly
important
when

we
need
to
ask
the
question

there
are
many
different
methods
and
approaches
to
answering
this
question
the
methods
differ

outline
the
goal
of
this
course
is
tying
various
models
of
computation
machines
grammars
functions
and
languages
understanding
the
relationship
among
them
is
essential
to
any
further
study
of
computer
science
machines
can
be
viewed
as
models
of
computation
we
study
various
types
of
machines
and
their
power
and
limitations
grammars
are
proposed
to
describe
the
languages
accpeted
by
these
machines
finding
the
relationships
and
proving
properties
require
formal
approaches
we
will
also
show
how
these
theories
can
be
applied
in
various
branches
of
computer
science
to
demonstrate
how
the
course
is
applicable
to
other
areas
and
to
enhance
the
understanding

dsm
system
the
treadmarks
distributed
shared
memory
dsm
system
treadmarks
supports
parallel
computing
on
networks
of
workstations
its
main
novel
feature
is
that
it
provides
a
global
shared
address
space
across
the
different
machines
on
a
cluster
the
shared
address
space
distinguishes
it
from
other
well
known
packages
such
as
pvm
that
provide
a
message
passing
interface
between
machines
there
is
growing
consensus
in
the
parallel
computing
community
that
a
shared
memory
interface
is
more
desirable
from
the
application
programmer
s
viewpoint
allowing
him
or
her
to
focus
on
algorithmic
development
rather
than
on
managing
communication
the
challenge
in
providing
a
shared
memory
interface
is
to
do
so
efficiently
to
this
end
treadmarks
incorporates
several
innovative
features
including
release
consistency
and
multiple
writer
protocols
current
research
going
on
in
the
treadmarks
project
includes
the
integration
of
compiler
and
runtime
techniques
the
use
of
high
level
synchronization
operators
and
the
use
of

winter
monsoon

based
on
the

ncep
ncar

in
addition
to
documenting
the
frequency

and
preferred
propagation
tracks
of
cold
surges
and
the
evolution
patterns
of
associated
fields
the
temporal
distribution
of
the
siberian
high
and
cold
surges
is
discussed
further
this
study
examines
the
interannual
variation
of
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
and
its
relationship
with
enso
there
are
on
average
thirteen
cold
surges
in
each
winter
season
october
to
april
of
which
two
are
strong
cases
the
averaged
intensity
of
cold
surges
measured
by
maximum
surface
pressure
is
1053
hpa
the
cold
surges
originate
from
two
primary
source
regions
1
northwest
of
lake
baikal
and
2
north
of
lake

trajectory
and
correlation
analyses
indicate
that
during
this
time
high
pressure
centers
propagate
southeastward
around
the
edge
of
the
tibetan
plateau
from
the
mentioned
source
regions
some
of
these
high
pressure
centers
then
move
eastward
and
diminish
over
the
ocean
while
others
proceed
southward
the

fields
propagate
farther
southward
and
eastward
the
affected
area
encompasses
the
bulk
of
the
maritime
continent
although
the
intensity
of
the
siberian
high
is
found
to
peak
during
december
and
january
the
frequency
of
cold
surges
has
a
maximum
in
november
and
in
march
this
result
suggests
that
november
through
march
should
be
considered
as
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
season
two
stratifications
of
cold
surges
are
used
to
examine
the
relationship
between
enso
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
winter
monsoon
the
first
one
described
as
the
conventional
cold

indicates
that
the
cold

frequency
reaches
a
minimum

the
second
one
defined
as
the
maximum

near
the
south

the
same

introduction
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
which
is
associated
with
a
strong
siberian
high
and
active
cold
surges
is
one
of
the
most
energetic
monsoon
circulation
systems
the
dramatic
shift
of
the
northeasterlies
and
the
outbreak
of
cold
surges
dominate
the
winter
weather
and
climate
in
the
east
asian
region
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
exert
a
strong
impact
on
the
extratropical
and
tropical
planetary
scale
circulations
chang
and
lau
1982
and
influence
the
ssts
in
the
tropical
western
pacific
chang
et
al
1979
their
general
characteristics
and
the
possible
linkage
between
cold
surges
and
tropical
atmospheric
and
oceanic
phenomena
have
been
examined
in
many
studies
for
example
chang
and
lau
1982
showed
that
the
outbreak
of
winter
monsoon
surges
forced
short
term
changes
in
the
hadley
and
walker
circulation
the
east
asian
jetstream
and
large
scale
deep
convection
over
the
equatorial
western
pacific
boyle
1986
a
1986
b
found
that
the
frequency
and
intensity
of
the
monsoon
surges
for
a
given
month
were
related
to
the
intensity
of
the
east
asian
jetstream
and
the
extratropical
large
scale
circulation
patterns
lau
and
chang
1987
suggested
that
the
interannual
variations
of
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
may
be
related
to
enso
and
tropical
intraseasonal
oscillations
ding
and
krishnamurti
1987
noted
an
eastward
shift
of
the
tropical
planetary
scale
divergent
circulation
in
association
with
the
cold
surges
which
was
very
similar
to
the
shift
of
the
divergent
circulation
between
el
nino
and
la
nina
years
however
little
attention
has
been
given
to
the
climatological
aspects
of
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
boyle

chang
1984

the
statistics
of
the
siberian
high
and
cold
air
outbreaks
in
china
with
emphasis
on
the
effect
to
local
weather
forecast
ding
and
krishnamurti
1987
summarized
the
climatological
tracks
of
cold
surges
based
on
the
data
from
the
winter
djf
of
1980
to
1984
although
the
winter
monsoon
was
much
weaker
than
normal
during
the
1982
83
el
nino
event
lau
and
chang
1987
there
has
never
been
a
systematic
investigation
on
the
relationship
between
enso
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
the
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
present
the
climatology
of
cold
surges
and
the
siberian
high
based
on
the
1979
1995
ncep
ncar
reanalysis
we
emphasize
the
temporal
and
spatial
distribution
of
the
cold
surges
and
the
siberian
high
their
origin
propagation
paths
and
evolution
patterns
of
particular
interest
is
the
interannual
variation
of
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
given
that
the
winter
monsoon
activity
was
weaker
during
the
1982
83
period
one
of
our
goals
is
to
determine
if
a
consistent
relationship
exists
between
enso
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold

here
to
serve
as
a
background
for
this

the

of

the
entire

and
yields
northeasterly
flow
over
a
large
part
of

at

hpa
the
flow
pattern
is
dominated
by
the
coastal
trough
the
intensity
of
this
trough
is
quasi
geostrophically
linked
to
the
surface
siberian
high
at
200
hpa
the
most
prominent
feature
is
the
east
asian
jet
near
japan
this
jet
the
strongest
on
the
globe
is
associated
with
intense
baroclinicity
large
vertical
wind
shear
and
strong
cold
advection
it
is
maintained
by
the
coriolis
torque
acceleration
exerted
on
the
ageostrophic

near
the

region
its
strength
is
inherently
related
to
the
intensity
of
the
surface

the
wind
blows
along
the
north
and
east
periphery
of
the

this
anticyclonic

pattern
is
a
reflection
of
the
quasi
stationary

system
south
of
30

n
where
the
siberian
high
pressure
exerts
less
influence
the
wind
maximum
near
the
south
china
sea
can
be
largely
attributed
to
the
cumulative
effects
of
the
cold
surges
one
of
the
main
features
of
this
field
is
that
the
westerly
flow
near
japan
bifurcates
the
eastward
branch
merges
with
the
aleutian
low
the
southern
branch
joins
the
tradewind
belt
cold

intensity
and
thickness
usually
reduce
significantly
as
the
airmass
moves

a

cold
surges
and
siberian
high
the
cold
surges
are
the
most
important
transient
disturbances
embedded
within
the
mean
monsoon
circulation
the
occurrence
of
a
cold
surge
is
characterized
by
a
southward
movement
of
a
surface
anticyclone
and
an
associated
abrupt
24
48
hours
surface
air
temperature
drop
in
the
affected
regions
the
typical
scenario
of
a
cold
air
outbreak
is
the
siberian
high
and
the
coastal
trough
reach
a
certain
intensity
further
west
over
the
continent
an

short
wave
undergoes

as

eventually
the
short
wave
develops
into
a
major

and
replaces
the
old
quasi
stationary
coastal
trough
during
this
process
a
surface
anticyclone
moves
southward
and
a

occurs

it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
build
up
and
maintenance
of
the
siberian
high
pressure
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
occurrence
of
cold
surges
radiative
cooling
persistent
cold
air
advection
usually
blocking
over
urals
throughout
the
troposphere
and
large
scale
descending
motion
all
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
the
cold
siberian
high
ding
and
krishnamurti
1987
however
cold
surges
should
not
be
regarded
as
the
simple
southward
expansion
or
temporal
variability
of
the
siberian
highs
rather
it
is
of
a
separate
dynamical
entity
the
siberian

and
the
cold

are
the
two
most

phenomena
of

criteria
for

objective
criteria
to
identify
the
cold

are
required
in
this
study
many
cold

definitions
can
be
found
in
the
literature
a
summary
of
the
often
used
definitions
is
given
in
boyle
and
chen
1987
some
of
the
cold
surges
are
purposely
defined
for
the
convenience
of
weather
forecasting
definitions
vary
depending
on
regions
of
interest
for
example
cold
surges
defined
over
the
south
china
sea
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
cold
surges
defined
near
korea
the
essence
of
the
cold
surges
as
mentioned
above
is
the
rapid
south
southeastward
movement
of
a
surface
anticyclone
which
brings
significant
surface
air
temperature
drop
in
the
affected
regions
in
defining
a
cold
surge
from
the
reanalysis
we
choose
to
average
the

however
the
usual
high

large

is
characterized
by
a
strong
siberian

and
an
intense
jetstream
this
pattern
is
unfavorable
for
the
occurrence
of
cold
surges
despite
the
abundance
of
cold
air
during
this
time
this
is
because
that
the
short
waves
tend
to
move
rapidly
through
such
a
pattern
without
causing
any
disturbances

background
on

hand
typically
has
a

this
flow
pattern
yields
a

an

criterion
of

is
the

during

the

the

it

to
induce

substantial
temperature
change
in
a
cold
background
while
the
surface

temperature
is
relatively
warmer
during

cold
air
and
anticyclones
with
modest
intensity
can
significantly
reduce
the

from
the
view
of

it
is
the
cold

that
occur
during
november
and
march
that
yield
a
more
abrupt
temperature
drop
have
the
most
significant
damaging
effect
on
local
agriculture
and
economy
recently
a
very
similar
monthly
distribution
of
cold

has
been
found
by
ding
and
collaborators
based
on
cold
surges
from
6

ding
personal
communication
1996
they
suggest
that
the
warm
and
moist
troughs
that
moving
out
of
the
bay
of
bengal
result
in
the
relatively
lower
frequency
cold
surges
during
december
and
january
as
mentioned
before
one
of
the
necessary
conditions
of
cold
surge
outbreak
is
that
the
siberian
high
reaches
a
certain
intensity
but
this
is
by
no
means
guarantee
that
the
cold
surge
frequency
should
monotonically
increase
as
the
siberian
high
intensifies
the
statistics
based
on
the
17
year
data
shown
here
and
ding
s
recent
results
do
not
support
quot
the
higher
the

the
greater
the
possibility
of

occurrence
quot
ding
1994
a
statement
that
has
been
mistakenly
known
in
the
forecasting
community
the
temporal
distribution
of
strong
cold
surges
is
examined
of
all
the
26
strong
cases
identified
20
of
them
occurred
in
december
january
and
february
and
five
in
november
only
one
in
march
and
none
during
october
or
april
the
strong
cold
surges
tend
to
occur
during
very
cold
months
this
suggests
that
large
surface
pressure
gradient
associated
with
a
very
strong
surface
anticyclone
and
abundant
sources
of
cold
air
is
an
important
driving
force
to
push
the
cold
air
far
into
the
tropics
this
result
also
suggests
that
the
intensity
of
the
siberian
high
may
be
related
to
the
occurrence
of
strong
cold
surges
that
affect
the
tropical
regions
because
the
cold
surge
frequency
is
high
in
november

the

dominates
a

summary
and

the
study
of
the
east

winter
monsoon
and
cold

from
the
1979

ncep
ncar
reanalyses
has
revealed
and
extended
several
noteworthy
climatological
features
of
the
winter
monsoon
according
to
the
conventional
cold
surge
criteria
about
13
cold
surges
occur
every
winter
season
of
which
two
are
strong
cases
that
influence
the
tropical
region
the
average
lifetime
of
the
cold
surges
is
about
7
days
and
the
average
intensity
of
highs
is
1053
hpa
the
strong
cases
usually
last
for
about
9
days
with
average
intensity
of
1060
hpa
the
cold
surges
tend
to
originate
from
two
source
regions
one
is
near
the
northwest
of
lake
baikal
and
the
other
is
to
the
north
of
lake
balkhash
the
high
pressure
centers
propagate
southeastward
and
end
in
the
east
and
southeast
of
china
and
surrounding
oceans
consistent
with
trajectories
of
pressure
centers
correlation
patterns
indicate
that
the
signature
of
associated
slp
surface
wind
and
surface
air
temperature
stretches
further
south
and
east
the
southward
extent
includes
the
bulk
of
the
maritime
continent
the
eastward
extent
reaches
150
deg
e
although
the
intensity
of
the
siberian
high
varies
according
to
the
season
and
reaches
its
peak
in
january
the
cold
surges
are
most
active
during
november
and
march
this
result
suggests
that
november
through
march
should
be
considered
as
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
season
it
also
indicates
that
the
occurrence
of
cold
surges
does
not
monotonically
increase
with
the
strengthening
of
the
siberian
high
an
empirical
rule
that
has
been
widely
believed
in
the
forecasting
community
examination
of
monthly
distribution
of
strong
cold
surges
indicates
however
that
the
majority
of
strong
cold
surges
occurs
during
djf
this
result
suggests
that
large
pressure
gradient
associated
with
strong
siberian
high
is
an
important
driving
force
to
push
the
cold
air
far
into
the
tropics
the
two
stratifications
of
cold
surges
are
revealing
when
considering
the
relationship
between
enso
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
cold
air
activity
the
first
stratification
as
described
in
the
cold
surge
identification
criteria
yields
result
that
is
consistent
with
the
in
situ
observation
from
bmc
the
interannual
variation
of
cold
surge
frequency
shows
that
minimum
surge
frequency
occurs
one
year
after
an
el
nino
event
the
second
stratification
based
on
the
maximum
meridional
wind
event
in
the
south
china

indicates
that
the
interannual
variation
of
the

is
in
good
agreement
with
the

by
means
of
both
pressure
and
wind
is
in
general
agreement
with
the
soi
both
the
strength
of
the
200
hpa
jetstream
and
the
500
hpa
trough
are
found
to
be
weaker
than
normal
during
el
nino
events
although
their
interannual
variation
patterns
do
not
agree
with
the
soi
as
closely
as
that
of
the
siberian
high
given
the
close
relationship
between
the
soi
and
the
interannual
variation
of
the
monsoon
meridional
wind
and
cold
surges
it
is
natural
to
wonder
why
some
of
the
monsoon
related
disturbances
either
originated
from
or
located
in
the
extratropics
exhibit
variation
patterns
similar
to
the
soi
and
what
are
the
physical
mechanisms
between
the
enso
winter
monsoon
interaction
during
a
typical
el
nino
year
the
convective
activity
in
the
maritime
continent
is
usually
reduced
if
the
cumulus
convection
in
this
region
is
one
of
the
most
important
monsoon
energy
sources
as
suggested
by
ramage
1971
the
suppression
of
the
maritime
convection
should
be
responsible
at
least
partly
for
the
weaker
than
normal
extratropical
monsoon
circulation
during
el
nino
events
with
the
available
observed
outgoing
longwave
radiation
olr
data
from
the
national
oceanic
and
atmospheric
administration
we
have
computed

the

from
1979
1992
the
overall
interannual
variation
pattern
not
shown
here
is
not
as
close
to
the
soi
as
that
of
the
south
china
sea
cold

or
the
siberian

however
negative

is
found
during
the
1988

likewise
positive
olr
anomalies
are
found
during
the
1982
83
and
1986
87
el

seasons
the
correlation
coefficient
between
the
olr
anomaly
and
the
soi
is
r
0

on
the
other
hand
evidence
indicated
that
the
winter
monsoon
and
cold
air
activity
can
greatly
affect
the
tropical
convective
activity
and
sst
slingo
1996
personal
communication
found
that
indonesian
convection
is
enhanced
when
cold
surges
penetrated
far
into
the
tropics
chang
et
al
1979
have
shown
that
cold
surges
are
capable
of
influencing
the
tropical
sst
but
whether
the
cold
surges
can
significantly
affect
the
tropical
region
as
has
been
discussed
depends
on
the
intensity
and
path
of
the
cold
surges
it
may
also
relate
to
the
background
large
scale
circulation
theoretical
studies
have
suggested
branstator
1983
lau
and
lim
1984
that
the
interaction
between
the
tropical
convection
and
midlatitude
circulation
depends
critically
on
the
relative
position
of
the
convection
and
extratropical
quasi
stationary
waves
it
has
also
been
suggested
that
the
interaction
between
cold
surges
and
convective
activities
near
the
maritime
continent
will
in
turn
modify
the
extratropical
and
tropical
synoptic
and
planetary
scale
circulations
chang
and
lau
1980
apparently
further
studies
are
much
needed
to
delineate
the
mechanism
of
the
interaction
between
the
winter
monsoon
and
convection
near
the
maritime
continent
in
summary
in
addition
to
extend
and
substantiate
the
climatological
aspects
of
the
east
asian
winter
monsoon
and
cold
surges
the
current
study
has
clearly
indicated
that
the
interannual
variation
of
the
south
china
sea
cold
surges
is
in
good
agreement
with
the
soi
the
south
china
sea
cold
surges
share
the
same
origin
with
the
conventionally
defined
cold
surges
they
also
dominate
the
variation
of
the
area
averaged

near

the

large

however
physical
mechanisms
responsible
for
the
interaction
between

and

are
still
not
well
understood
especially
problems
on

relevant

description
this
research
program
attempts
to
give
a
formal
theory
of
predication
within
the
context
of
relevance
logic
for
an
implication
to
be
relevant
there
must
be
some
connection
between
its
antecedent
and
consequent
correspondingly
in
order
for
a
predication
to
be
relevant
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
predicate
and
the
term
of
which
it
is
predicated
this
project
in
philosophical
logic
has
a
link
to
the
computer
science
notion
of
a
strict
function
one
that
depends
on
its
arguments
a
definition
of
relevant
predication
can
be
given
within
relevance
logic
with
identity
and
its
formal
properties
are
being
explored
and
linked
with
various
ontological
issues
concerning
predication
this
include
vacuous
predication
external
relations
the
question
of
whether
existence
is
a
property
and
whether
membership
and
exemplification
are
relations
there
are
also
applications
to
the
philosophy
of
science
in
connection
with
the
goodman
grue
bleen
paradox
and
other
paradoxes
of
confirmation
applications
have
also
been
made

learning
intelligent
learning
environments
summary
the
cognition
and
technology
group
at
vanderbilt
ctgv
is
developing
the
jasper
woodbury
problem
solving
series
a
videodisc
based
program
designed
to
motivate
students
and
help
them
learn
to
think
and
reason
mathematically
about
complex
realistic
problems
as
part
of
this
project
we
are
developing
a
collection
of
computer
based
learning
environments
that
incorporate
the
project
s
constructivist
theories
generative
learning
techniques
and
anchoring
macrocontexts
into
an
intelligent
learning
environment
design
the
resulting
paradigm
macrocontexts
plus
microworlds
mpms
where
microworld
exploration
and
problem
solving
is
anchored
within
an
interesting
macrocontext
two
systems
we
have
constructed
and
tested
are
adventureplayer
a
trip
planning
microworld
that
can
be
anchored
to
a
jasper
macrocontext
this
system
allows
students
to
construct
evaluate
and
reason
about
solutions
to
trip
planning
problems
and
smarttools
also
linked
to
a
trip
planning
microworld
where
students
study
and
develop
graphical
tools
to
quickly
answer
various
questions
about
distance
time
rate
and
gas
consumption
this
system
has
also
been
used
as
a
test
bed
for
studying
the
richness
of
computer
traces
for
protocol
analysis
both
systems
incorporate
beneficial
aspects
of
both
intelligent
tutoring
systems
and
cognitive
tools
through
reflective
interaction
scaffolding
and
coaching
current
work
in
this
area
is
focusing
on
an
onr
sponsored
project
for
studying
student
understanding
of
ac
circuit
concepts
the
goal
is
to
develop
appropriate
instructional
methodologies
and
computer
based
environments
for
training
technicians
in
complex
maintenance
and

the
trains
project
natural
spoken
dialogue
and
interactive
planning
the
trains
project
at
the
university
of
rochester
department
of
computer
science
is
a
long
term
effort
to
develop
an
intelligent
planning
assistant
that
is
conversationally
proficient
in
natural
language
the
goal
is
a
fully
integrated
system
involving
online
spoken
and
typed
natural
language
together
with
graphical
displays
and
gui
based
interaction
the
primary
application
has
been
a
planning
and
scheduling
domain
involving
a
railroad
freight
system
where
the
human
manager
and
the
system
must
cooperate
to
develop
and
execute
plans
research
in
the
trains
project
has
been
along
two
tracks
first
the
project
has
supported
ph
d
thesis
research
in
natural

processing
speech
interpretation
discourse
processing
planning
and
reasoning
under
uncertainty
complete
references
are
available
from
the
resources
given
below
second
over
the
course
of
the
project
we
have
periodically
pulled
the
research
threads
together
and
produced
limited
but
working
demonstration
systems
based
on
the
theories
the
hope
is
that
this
incremental
development
is
converging
towards
the
ultimate
goal
of
a
fully
conversant
system
details
of
these
systems
are
also
available
from
many
of
the
references
given
below
and
in
particular
in
the

current
research
in

work
in
progress

a
global
network
to
eliminate
nuclear
weapons
abolition
2000
a
global
network
to
eliminate
nuclear
weapons
the
abolition
2000
network
is
a
network
of
over
300
organisations
and
growing
on
every
continent
working
for
the
abolition
of
nuclear
weapons
it
grew
from
many
seeds
the
world
court
project
the
international
coalition
for
non
proliferation
the
global
alliance
against
nuclear
arms
the
abolition
caucus
etc
all
of
these
movements
are
like
streams
that
l
ed
into
the
river
that
is
the
abolition
2000
network
it
is
not
a
membership
body
but
is
open
to
all
organisations
endorsing
the
abolition
statement
drafted
at
the
npt
conference
in
new
york
in
1995
its
over
arching
premise
is
the
vision
of
entering
the
21
st
century
with
a
plan
in
place
f
or
the
elimination
of
nuclear
weapons
what
is
the
network
300
organisations
have
organised
themselves
into
what
was
termed
a
tight
rather
than
the
usual
loose
network
which
aims
to
provide
group
s
concerned
with
nuclear
issues
a
forum
for
the
exchange
of
information
and
the
development
of
joint
initiatives
the
tightness
of
the
network
like
the
tautness
of
a
web
is
defined
by
how
close
the
members
of
the
network
work
together
and
how
good
the
lines
of
communication
are
the
network
plans
to
have
an
office
in
california
usa
staffed
by
a
facilitator
the
global
network
office
will
be
overseen
by
a
management
group
the
substantive
work
of
the
network
is
done
by
international
working
groups
on
issues
relating
to
the
abolition
of
nuclear
weapons
how
did
it
come
about
in
1995
at
the
conference
to
review
and
extend
the
non
proliferation
treaty
in
new
york
a
group
of
40
to
50
activists
representing
ngos
from
all
around
the
world
met
each
day
to
coordinate
their
work
and
called
themselves
the
abolition
caucus
this
group
drafted
a
consensus
document
which
was
known
as
the
abolition
statement
in
less
than
two
weeks
the
first
200
organisations
had
signed
the
statement
and
this
number
is
still
growing
added
to
this
the
international
coalition
for
non
proliferation
organised
a
meeting
during
the
npt
conference
on
a
draft
nuclear
weapons
convention
called
beyond
the
npt
the
demand
for
a
convention
became
the
prime
focus
of
the
lobbying
work
of
the
abolition
caucus
and
also
of
the
abolition
statement
they
called
on
the
delegates
to
initiate
immediately
and
conclude
by
the
year
2000
negotiations
on
a
nuclear
weapons
abolition
convention
that
requires
the
phased
elimination
of
all
nuclear
weapons
within
a
timebound
framework
with
provisions
for
effective
verification
and
enforcement
the
abolition
caucus
requested
the
npt
parties
to
adopt
this
goal
in
the
final
report
of
the
conference
the
opposition
to
the
indefinite
unconditional
extension
of
the
npt
was
clearly
expressed
in
the
original
statement
which
has
since
been
updated
to
remove
references
to
the
conference
and
other
dates
development
of
the
network
a
core
group
went
on
to
organise
a
further
meeting
in
the
hague
to
coincide
with
the
oral
hearings
at
the
international
court
of
justice
in
november
1995
of
the
advisory
opinion
on
the
use
and
threat
of
use
of
nuclear
weapons
world
court
project
the
60
participants
at
this
meeting
agreed
by
consensus
to
found
a
network
and
defined
its
structure
the
title
abolition
2000
a
global
network
to
eliminate
nuclear
weapons
was
chosen
the
idea
of
a
tight
network
consisting
of
regions
working
groups
and
a
distribution
communications
centre
later
titled
the
global
network
office
was
born
most
importantly
it
was
decided
that
there
should
be
no
central
committee
to
take
decisions
on
behalf
of
the
network
and
that
initially
no
common
strategy
would
be
decided
except
to
take
action
under
the
only
agreed
common
position
the
abolition
statement
which
everybody
had
signed
the
group
that
had
organised
the
meeting
in
the
hague
was
given
the
task
of
setting
up
the
office
and
finding
the
funding
for
a
staff
person
for
it
a
second
meeting
in
edinburgh
in
march
1996
gave
this
group
the
title
interim
management
group
whose
function
is
solely
to
oversee
the
functioning
of
the
global
network
office

the
work
of
this
group
refers
to
the
points
on
testing
in
the
abolition
statement
working
for
a
truly
comprehensive
test
ban
that
prevents
development
of
nuclear
weapons
and
for
the
closure
of
the
test
sites
the
ctbt
negotiations
are
now
underway
in
geneva
the
test
ban
will
most
likely
not
be
comprehensive
because
the
nuclear

states
have
developed
the
technical
capability
to
replace
testing
computer

will
be
an
important

of

these
are
the

to
continue
collecting

with

and

of

the
group
is
campaigning
to
get
language
introduced
into
the
preamble
of
the
ctbt
language
available
from
jackie
cabasso
that
will
specifically
refer
to
the
prevention
of
the
development
of
nuclear
weapons
as
the
intention
of
the
treaty
the
concept
of
the
test
ban
and
beyond
is
to
favour
an
early
conclusion
of
the
ctbt
while
recognising
that

will
not

the

in
geneva
plans
to
negotiate
a
fissile

cut
off
after
completion
of
the
ctbt
discussions
at

are
around
the
issues
of
banning
fissile
material
completely
i
e
destroying
stock
piles
and
the
production
of
fissile
materials
in
the
civilian
sector
if
the
stockpiles
remain
the
present
status
quo
will
be
perpetuated
as
with
th
e
npt
and
most
likely
with
the
ctbt
that
the
declared
nuclear
weapons
states
retain
their
capability
while
forbidding
it
for
all
others
this
is
not
disarmament
disallowing
fissile
material
production
only
in
the
military
and
not
in
the
civilian
sector
repeats
the
mistake
of
the
npt
by
ignoring
that
nuclear
energy
produces
bomb
material
that
can
be
diverted
legally
or
illegally
for
military
purposes
the
question
of
fissile

production
is
important

the
recent
explosion
of
interest
in
the
world
wide
web
has
resulted
in
an
evolving
set
of
protocols
for
using
it
these
protocols
address
the
traditional
concerns
of
operating
systems
interprocess
communication
resource
allocation
security
etc
but
do
so
in
the
more
general
context
of
the
internet
the
goal
of
this
class
is
to
provide
an
understanding
of
the
current
state
of
the
art
in
web
operating
systems
and
also
to
address
problems
that
must
be
solved
to
provide
a
mature
general
purpose
web
operating
system
a
key
hypothesis
behind
the
design
of
this
class
is
that
many
of
the
issues
now
being
addressed
in
the
context
of
the
web
also
have
been
addressed
in
other
more
traditional
areas
of
operating
systems
we
will

may

this
project
is
the
current
form
of
a
long
term
effort
by
jon
barwise
to
come
to
grips
with
the
relationship
between
the
concept
of
information
and
logical
notions
like
inference
and
proof
what
is
information
what
is
it
that
makes
your
screen
carry
information
about
what
is
going
on
at
indiana
university
how
does
this
notion
of
information
fit
into
standard
notions
of
logic
and
logical
system
over
the
past
year
or
two
in
joint
work
with
seligman
barwise
has
come
to
see
this
problem
as
one
of
trying
to
understand
the
logical
structure
of
distributed
systems
this
idea
has
led
to
a
mathematical
framework
containing
notions
like
local
logic
and
information
channel
which
seems
very
promising

of
medical
decision
making
and
to
use
artificial
intelligence
ai
methods
to
reproduce
it
in
computer
programs
such
programs
could
help
prevent
cognitive
errors
in
health
care
bring
medical
expertise
to
underserved
parts
of
the
world
and
improve
medical
education
and
training
accordingly
the
laboratory
s
clinical
decision
making
group
seeks
to
learn
how
doctors
think
about
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
various
medical
conditions
and
how
their
approaches
may
be
captured
by
ai
methods
the
greatest
challenge
in
building
computer
programs
designed
to
mimic
medical
reasoning
is
that
they
must
deal
with
many
complexities
diseases
may
appear
in
unusual
combinations
for
example
and
exhibit
variable
symptoms
medical
care
also
is
rife
with
basic
uncertainties
because
of
our
incomplete
understanding
of
disease
and
because
of
normal
variations
among
patients
further
complicating
the
issues
ai
programs
must
reflect
individual
patient
values
and
preferences
regarding
decisions
about
potentially
risky
diagnostics
and
treatments
working
with
physicians
from
nearby
institutions
including
new
england
medical
center
and
children
s
hospital
we
are
exploring
the
ways
in
which
medical
knowledge
is
represented
and
how
disease
may
be
explained
as
physiological
derangements
of
the
healthy
individual
theoretical
efforts
develop
general
techniques
for
representing
physiological
anatomical
and
biochemical
knowledge
exploring
the
consequences
of
disease
pathologies
evaluating
time
dependent
data
and
eliciting
and
representing
patient
preferences
empirical
studies
involve
implementation
of
computer
programs
that
solve
specific
medical
challenges
evaluation
of
the
capabilities
and
usefulness
of
such
programs
helps
lead
to
a
better
understanding
of
future
research
needs
specific
projects
within
the
group
are
selected
based
on
the
clinical
importance
of
various
disorders
and
on
their
usefulness
in
designing
new
ai
related
technologies
currently
we
are
working
on
applications

cornell
s
horus
effort
has
developed
a
programming
environment
for
reliable
distributed
computing
during
the
last
year
horus
was
used
to
demonstrate
groupware
and
fault
tolerance
over
high
performance
networks
and
was
found
to
offer
higher
performance
than
other
similar
systems
novel
features
of
horus
are
its
flexible
software
architecture
in
which
applications
pay
only
for
features
that
they
use
and
support
for
virtually
synchronous
process
groups
a
technology
that
we
developed
in
our
prior
work
on
the
isis
toolkit
which
has
become
a
significant
commercial
success
horus
also
offers
a
fault
tolerant
security
and
privacy
technology
which
we
view
as
an
important
research
advance
during
1995
we
will
be
extending
horus
to
provide
extremely
low
latency
high
performance
real
time
capabilities
our
approach
combines
elements
of
a
communication
technology
called
active
messages
with
a
multi
media
playback
system
called
continuous
media
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
expect
to
demonstrate
high
speed
interactive
applications
with
remote
multimedia
servers
such
as
might
be
used
in
remote
telemedicine
applications
or
video
on
demand
systems
all
of
this
will
retain
the
existing
fault
tolerance
and
security
options
of
horus
and
its
virtual
synchrony
programming
model
prior
work
on
isis
has
created
a
substantial
user
base
and
we
expect
rapid
uptake
of
horus
within
this
community
as
it
matures
isis
users
span
a
wide
range
of
industries
including
telecommunications
systems
financial
trading
systems
stock
market
automation
factory
floor
process
control
for
discrete
electronic
component
manufacture
air
traffic
control
and
space
based
communications
system
management
and
control
applications
of
isis
are
being
explored
in
several
branches
of
the
military
as
well
as
the
nsa
and
other
non
military
government
branches
among
the
more
visible
military
efforts
is
the
naval
hiper
d
project
which
is
exploring
the
use
of
isis
in
a
new
system
that
prototypes
technologies
for
future
enhancements
of
the
aegis
battle
radar
system
the
more
demanding
applications
in
this
user
base
would
benefit
from
access
to
horus
and
our
initial
plan
is
to
make
it
possible
to
migrate
isis
applications
to
horus
with
few
changes
thus
benefiting
this
community
in
a
direct
way
technology
transition
has
occured
through
licensing
agreements
with
isis
distributed
systems
inc
a
subsidiary
of
stratus
computers
however
all
of
our
cornell
work
is
also
available
to
researchers
at
no
fee
and
is
described
through
detailed
publications
and
programming
manuals
looking
to
the
future
we
hope
that
a
mixture
of
isis
and
horus
technologies
will
permit
us
to
develop
some
of
the
very
demanding
applications
that
will
be
seen
in
next
generation
groupware
and
planning
systems
the
illustration
below
shows
such
an
application
a
military
mission
control
and
planning
system
that
integrates
data
from
a
variety
of
space
air
and
ground
resources
and
uses
this
to
coordinate
actions
of
various
theatre
assets
systems
of
this
sort
will
demand
the
utmost
in
performance
reliability
and
security
while
also
tolerating
failures
and
rapidly
reconfiguring
to
respond
to
changing
demands
success
in
our
project
will
thus
impact
a
wide
range
of
both
civilian
and
military

overview
the
content
of
this
course
will
depend
largely
on
student
backgrounds
in
any
case
we
will
take
an
in
depth
look
at
design
and
implementation
issues
for
object
oriented
programming
languages
your
core
activity
will
be
to
implement
a
variety
of
object
oriented
language
mechanisms
using
scheme
we
will
develop
a
core
language
implementation
and
the
programming
assignments
will
typically
involve
extending
this
core
in
various
ways
this
should
give
you
a
chance
to
spend
less
time
coding
and
more
time
thinking
we
will
spend
a
significant
part
of
our
lecture
time
discussing
the
assignments
and
presenting
solutions
the
problems
tend
to
be
open
ended
and
we
learn
a
lot
from
seeing
how
others
approach
a
problem
these
are
not
formal
presentations
and
you
should
come
to
every
class
prepared
to
present
your
current
work
around
the
middle
of
the
term
you
will
also
be
asked
to
pick
a
topic
for
a
short
paper
the
paper
will
address
one
of
the
topics
raised
in
the
course
and
should
involve
a
literature
survey
as
well
as
some
original
thought
the
paper
will
be
due
by
the
end
of
finals

i
will
probebly

cranes
and
pressure
vessels
they
manufacture
in

1800

height
of
the
robot
above
the

manually
at
b
before
using
workspace
the
robot
program
was
generated
entirely
by
using
the
teach
pendant
on
the
shop
floor
since
9
axes
are
used
it
can
be
difficult
for
the
operator
to
visualise
all
possible
configurations
due
to
the
size
of
the
i
beams
cimtas
have
encountered
many
problems
in
getting
the
robots
to
achieve
satisfactory
welds
without
exceeding
a
robot
joint
limit
or
having
the
welding
tool
collide
with
the
workpiece
it
is
possible
to
move
the
robot
up
and
down
along
the
vertical
track
b
but
only
by
unbolting
it
and
winching
it
into
position
this
makes
it
difficult
to
experiment
with
different
heights
above
the
floor
project
aims
to
experiment
with
different
robot
and
table
configurations
to
maximise
the
work
envelope
to
minimise
the
possibility
of
a
collision
when
the
robot
re
orients
itself
during
its
task
to
improve
safety
for
the
human
operator
to
reduce
the
need
for
teach
pendant
programming
to
optimise
the
robot
program
and
reduce
cycle
time
the
solution
a
model
of
the
workcell
was
created
with
workspace
and
the
srv12l
and
arcmate
were
compared
for
reachability
the
workspace
facility
to
plot
the
working
envelope
was
used
to
position
the
work
piece
optimally
it
was
immediately
found
that
in
this
application
the
reis
srv12l
robot
allowed
a
greater
working
envelope
so
this
robot
was
chosen
in
place
of
the
arcmate
for
the
workcell
by
using
workspace
it
was
possible
to
make
the
vertical
track
b
a
translational
joint
on
the
rotating
column
a
this
allowed
the
height
of
the
robot
to
be
optimised
by
simply
changing
a
variable
in
the
simulation
work
then
began
on
developing
a
set
of
teach
points
which
the
robot
could
follow
without
hitting
a
joint
limit
or
colliding
with
the
workpiece
it
was
found
that
repositioning
the
column
a
between
welds
enabled
several
particularly
difficult
moves
to
be
achieved
previously
cimtas
had
simply
placed
the
mechanism
so
that
it
was
at
right
angles
to
the
linear
track
c
for
the
duration
of
the
cycle
collisions
tended
to
arise
if
the
robot
was
forced
to
reorient
the
wrist
during
a
linear
move
along
a
welding
seam
the
simulation
highlights
any
collisions
and
allows
the
user
to
abandon
a
move
and
immediately
try
another
approach
cimtas
financial
justification
for
workspace
a
complete
set
of
teach
points
to
perform
the
task
was
generated
these
teach
points
were
later
used
directly
in
a
new
program
generated
on
cimtas
text
based
off
line
programming
system
time
to
develop
the
new
program
was
reduced
by
over
40
development
of
the
new
program
was
achieved
off
line
while
the
robot
was
operating
a
technical
decision
was
made
to
use

the
resource
bounded
reasoning
research
group
is
part
of
the
department
of
computer
science
at
the
university
of
massachusetts
amherst
the
group
headed
by
professor
shlomo
zilberstein
studies
the
implications
of
limited
computational
resources
on
the
design
of
intelligent
agents
the
group
conducts
research
in
decision
theory
real
time
planning
autonomous
agent
architectures
and
reasoning
under
uncertainty
what
is
resource
bounded
reasoning
resource
bounded
reasoning
is
an
emerging
field
within
artificial
intelligence
that
is
concerned
with
the
construction
of
intelligent
systems
that
can
operate
in
real
time
environments
under
uncertainty
and
limited
computational
resources
research
in
this
field
covers
the
construction
composition
and
meta
level
control
of
computational
methods
that
allow
small
quantities
of
computational
commodities
such
as
time
memory
or
information
to
be
traded
for
gains
in
the
value
of
computed
results
why
is
it
needed
the
need
to
employ
resource
bounded
reasoning
techniques
is
based
on
a
simple
but
general
observation
in
many
complex
domains
the
computational
resources
required
to
reach
an
optimal
decision
reduce
the
overall
utility
of
the
result
this
observation
covers
a
wide
range
of
applications
such
as
medical
diagnosis
and
treatment
combinatorial
optimization
probabilistic
inference
mobile
robot
navigation
and
information
gathering
what
is
common
to
all
these
problems
is
that
it
is
not
feasible
computationally
or
desirable
economically
to
compute
the
optimal
answer
moreover
taking
the
cost
of
decision
making
into
account
is
not
an
easy
task
since
the
optimal
level
of
deliberation
varies
from
situation
to
situation
it
is
therefore
beneficial
to
build
systems
that
can
tradeoff
computational
resources
for
quality
of
results
advantages
of
resource
bounded
reasoning
from
the
early
days
of
ai
heuristic
methods
and
satisficing
techniques
have
been
used
to
address
the
problem
of
computational
complexity
resource
bounded
reasoning
techniques
have
two
important
advantages
over
those
previous
approaches
they
shift
the
attention
from
design
time
solutions
to
more
flexible
run
time
solutions
and
they
seek
to
optimize
rather
than
satisfice
solution
quality
the
shift
to
run
time
control
of
deliberation
improves
the
capability
of
intelligent
systems
to
deal
with
two
primary
sources
of
uncertainty
the
first
source
is
internal
to
the
system
and
relates
to
its
capability
to
produce
incrementally
improving
solutions
and
to
assess
their
quality
the
second
source
of
uncertainty
is
external
and
relates
to
unpredictable
change
in
the
environment
in
which
the
system
operates
run
time
control
of
deliberation
seeks
to
reduce
the
effect
of
these
uncertainties
on
the
performance
of
the
system
optimization
of
decision
quality
is
another
distinctive
feature
of
resource
bounded
reasoning
that
is
instead
of
building
systems
that
find
a
good
answer
the
goal
of
resource
bounded
reasoning
techniques
is
to
find
an
optimal
answer
optimality
however
is
defined
with
respect
to
the
system
knowledge
and
computational
capabilities
typically
an
optimal
answer
does
not
require
maximal
solution
quality
hence
these
systems
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
bounded
optimal
or
bounded
rational

emphasis
on
multiprogrammed
operating
systems
topics
include
process
synchronization
deadlock
memory
management
input

methods
information
sharing
protection
and
security
and
file
systems
the
impact
of
network

prerequsites
complete
familiarity
with
the
material
of
cs314
is
assumed
in
particular
a
knowledge
of
computer
architecture
assembly
programming
language
and
program
structure
is
required
i
ll
cover
some
of
the
introductory
material
in

as
required
but
the
purpose
of
that
will
be
to
remind
the
audience
of
the
material

course
outline
the
course
will
be
organized
roughly
as
follows
i
say
roughly
because
depending
on
the
feedback
from
the
class
i
may
change
the
order
or
the
content
of
particular
sections
we
ll
start
off
with
an
overview
of
concurrency
issues
we
ll
discuss
synchronization
issues
in
particular
ensuring
mutual
exclusion
deadlock
detections
and
prevention
algorithms
we
ll
discuss
multiprocessor
issues
as
well
next
we
ll
go
on
to
memory
management
here
we
ll
discuss
virtual
memory
and
various
methods
used
to
implement
virtual
memory
such
as
paging
and
segmentation
next
we
ll
cover
file
systems
finally
we
ll
look
at
evolution
of
the
traditional
operating
systems
and
look
at
micro
kernels
if
time
permits
we
ll
have
a
few
lectures
on
advanced
topics
such
as
multi
threading
and
serverless
file
systems

this
project
is
developing
techniques
that
improve
locality
of
reference
in
parallel
programs
so
as
to
admit
efficient
execution
on
large
scale
multiprocessors
we
use
a
combination
of
simulation
analytic
studies
and
experimentation
to
compare
alternative
techniques
for
locality
management
under
various
architectural
assumptions
using
a
wide
variety
of
benchmark
applications
we
seek
to
quantify
the
performance
impact
of
individual
techniques
at
the
architecture
operating
system
runtime
library
and
user
level
and
the
interaction
between
techniques
across
layers
in
the
system
this
work
will
lead
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
role
of
locality
and
data
sharing
in
parallel
program
performance
and
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
effectiveness
of
techniques
for
locality
management
and
their
interactions

the

multiprocessor
simulator
mint
is
a
software
package
designed
to
ease
the
process
of
constructing
event
driven
memory
hierarchy
simulators
for
multiprocessors
it
provides
a
set
of
simulated
processors
that
run
standard
unix
executable
files
compiled
for
a
mips
r3000
based
multiprocessor
these
generate
multiple
streams
of
memory
reference
events
that
drive
a
user
provided
memory
system
simulator
mint
uses
a
novel
hybrid
technique
that
exploits
the
best
aspects
of
native
execution
and
software
interpretation
to
minimize
the
overhead
of
processor
simulation
combined
with
related
techniques
to
improve
performance
this
approach
makes
simulation
on
uniprocessor
hosts
extremely
efficient

love
or
be
loved
if
we
don
146
t
love
ourselves
how
can
we
break
the
grip
of
our
past
to
create
a
glittering
new
reality
fortunately
our
modern
dilemma
is
ancient
it
has
been
the
challenge
of
all
peoples
in
every
age
tantra
offers
a
solution
in
the
search
for
the
beloved
ancient
wisdom
for
modern
healing
from
within
the
legalized
structure
and
rigidity
of
hindu
society
emerged
a
group
of
rebels
who
believed
that
personal
and
human
evolution
lay
beyond
the
restrictions
of
traditional
castes
and
laws
they
proved
that
freedom
could
produce
excellence
while
legislation
only
produced
stagnation
they
became
masters
of
themselves
discarding
moribund
traditions
for
self
knowledge
they
included
scientists
who
postulated
atomic
structure
astronomers
who
understood
the
solar
system
mathematicians
who
created
the
concept
of
zero
negative
numbers
and
the
decimal
place
and
metaphysicians
who
discovered
the
aura
astral
travel
and
the
chakras
they
became
masters
of
every
craft
and
art
they
called
themselves
tantrics
which
refers
to
expansion
and
the
weaving
of
energy
their
wisdom
is
a
gift
of
3
000
years
by
rejecting
empty
ritual
and
rigid
dogma
they
were
able
to
recapture
the
true
essence
of
hinduism
tantra
and
hinduism
both
utilize
a
triad
of
forces
to
be
used
by
the
seeker
creation
transcendence
and
preservation
these
forces
symbolize
steps
realizations
or
stages
of
initiation
for
the
tantra
practitioner
in
the
search
for
the
beloved
brahma
the
creator
the
creative
force
is
symbolized
by
brahma
and
his
female
counterpart
saraswati
the
patroness
of
the
64
tantric
arts
our
creative
forces
are
given
birth
in
artistic
expression
especially
in
the
art
of
love
tantra
sees
our
body
and
the
expression
of
the
senses
as
a
way
of
producing
energy
to
be
redirected
inwards
and
channelled
healing
our
thoughts
and
feelings
about
sensuality
and
our
bodies
is
an
important
first
step
in
producing
this
energy
vishnu
the
sustainer
the
second
tantric
force
is
deified
by
vishnu
the
preserver
and
his
counterpart
lakshmi
he
maintains
life
and
propagates
love
laksmi
is
the
embodiment
of
material
prosperity
and
spiritual
wealth
tantra
teaches
techniques
for
maintaining
heightened
sensual
awareness
using
secret
rituals
positions
visualization
mantras
and
yantras
shiva
the
transcendental
the
third
principle
is
transformation
as
symbolized
by
shiva
lord
over
death
and
his
counterpart
kali
the
destroyer
of
illusion
the
universe
is
constantly
chan
ging
nothing
remains
static
transcendence
or
145
going
beyond
146
the
limitation
of
ordinary
existence
is
the
embodiment
of
tantra
and
is
revealed
through
sexual
secrets
in
learning
how
to
extend
from
the
mundane
to
the
metaphysical
the
lover
takes
the
sexual
energy
created
with
his
beloved
and
transforms
it
into
a
life
wave
a
force
transcendental
to
achieve
liberation
from
death
into
pure
undifferentiated
consciousness
inner
channels
chakras
tantra
literature
elaborately
describes
the
human
energy
system
sadhanas
or
practices
are
prescribed
for
the
initiated
to
experience
the
movement
of
this
energy
universal
force
enters
through
the
top
of
the
head
and
is
distributed
down
and
out
through
the
body
in
a
series
of
channels
nadis
our
perception
of
the
changing
world
of
maya
illusion
is
created
when
this
energy
is
directed
outwards
through
our
senses
sight
hearing
smell
taste
and
touch
tantra
practices
involve
withdrawing
this
energy
from
the
outer
illusions
and
redirecting
it
upwards
as
awakened
kundalini
energy
through
a
channel
called
the
inner
flute
a
series
of
wheel
like
inner
vortices
called
chakras
intersect
with
this
main
channel
the
inner
traveller
can
experience
transformation
and
connections
with
other
realities
at
these
stages
as
this
energy
is
redirected
upwards
when
the
energy
again
reaches
the
crown
of
the
head
it
becomes
ultimately
transformed
into
the
nectar
of
immortality
producing
inner
erotic
ecstasy
this
experience
of
samadhi
is
the
objective
of
the
tantric
seeker
mantras
cosmic
sounds
mantra
is
an
important
component
in
tantric
work
a
mantra
is
a
primordial
sound
which
can
be
repeated
to
produce
a
cumulative
stream
of
focused
cosmic
and
bodily
energy
for
specific
purposes
om
is
the
sound
that
created
the
universe
and
its
continuation
resonates
and
maintains
all
existence
om
is
the
sound
of
true
love
and
when
chanted
it
calls
forth
the
beloved
the
sound
hrim

resonance

there
are
typically
gates
of

to
a
succession
of
patterns
representing
stages
of
atunement
often
with
accompanying
deities

a
central
point

the

is
united
with

a
symbol
of
male

female
forces

symbolizing

many
cultures

tantra
teaches
that
our
path
begins
as
an
inner
journey
the
work
we
initially
are
presented
with
is
the
movement
and
purification
of
our
subtle
energies
when
the
seeker
is
ready
however
the

appear

can
join

the
current
focus
is
on
processing
of
bi
level
images
such
as
text
pages
and
bar
codes
theoretically
the
pixels
of
such
images
can
have
only
two
possible
values
the
practical
situation
is
quite
different
the
optical
system
of
the
scanner
causes
blurring
illumination
may
be
uneven
and
so
forth
as
a
result
the
scanned
images
contain
a
range
of
values
simple
techniques
such
as
thresholding
have
serious
limitations
the
laboratory
has
pioneered
techniques
that
allow
the
recovery
of
the
ideal
image
even
when
blurring

other

are
severe

pearl
probabilistic

this
is

for

and
we
will
read
several
chapters
you
can
probably
get
by

it
if

though
it
s
a
nice
reference
book
shafer
and
pearl
readings
in

this
is
a
nice
collection
of
foundational
papers
on

and

and
we
will

probability

fragmentary
edition
of

this
is
an
extremely
interesting
technical
and
historical
look
at
the
foundations
of
probability
theory
statistics
and
decision
theory
definitely
worth
looking
at
for
the
reference
list
and
historical
perspective
alone
the
math
can
be
heavy
going
in
places
but
it
s
beautifully
written
neapolitan
probabilistic
reasoning
in
expert
systems
theory
and
algorithms
a
significant
overlap
with
the
pearl
book
so
a
good
secondary
source
for
information
about
graphical
models
and
propagation
algorithms
this
is

will
count
for

of
your
grade
and
will
be
due
on
december
13
th
for
those
of
you
doing
data
analysis
on
a
pc
i
suggest
you
consider
using
the
goldwave
digital
audio
editor
this
is
a
shareware
package
that
can
be
found
on
the
caen
pentium
machines
in
the
media
union
the
program
is
located
on
the
s
drive
in
the
bin
goldwave
directory
goldwave
does
not
replace
matlab
for
doing
fourier
analysis
filtering
lpc
modelling
etc
but
it
is
a
good
tool
for
manipulation
of
audio
at
the
sample
level
and
performing
simple
transformations
such
as
volume
adjustments
most
importantly
goldwave
is
an
excellent
tool
for
performing
conversions
between
audio
formats
and
extracting
short
segments
of
your
waveforms
for
input
to
matlab
goldwave
will
for
example
convert
wav
files
to
from
matlab
format
if
you
d
like
some
data
to
play
with
and
don
t
have
any
of
your
own
yet
here
are
2
sample
files
that
you
can
use
they
are
recordings
of
prof
wakefield
s
voice
pronouncing
5
vowels
as
heard
in
class
use
your
browser
s
save
link
as
feature
to
save
these
to
a
file
in
your
account
shift
left
click
instead
of
just
left
click
if
you
are
using
netscape
note
these
sounds
are
currently
corrupted
due
to
a
bad
file
transfer
i
will
have
fixed
versions
of
these
sounds
available
asap
the
gwvowel
raw
file
is
in
raw
i
e
headerless
16
bit
signed
monophonic
format
this
file
was
created
on
a
pc
so
it
is
in
little
endian
format
meaning
the
least
significant
8
bits
of
each
16
bit
sample
comes
first
in
the
file
if
you
want
to
do
your
experiments
on
a
big
endian
machine
such
as
a
sun
or
hp
you
should
use
this
file
gwbsw
raw
which
is
the
same
data
but
it
has
already
been
byte
swapped
for
you
if
you
use
the
wrong
file
there
ll
be
no
doubt
about
it
when
you
play
it
over
speakers
or
headphones
matlab
code
here
is
some
matlab
code
that
may
be
of
use
or
of
interest
you
can
get
the
code
by
clicking
on
each
link
copying
the
code
and
pasting
it
into
an
editor
window
easier
is
to
use
your
browser
s
save

as
function
to
save
the

to

using

on
a

the
hypercomputing
and
design
project
the
hypercomputing
and
design
project
the
web
pages
for
hpcd
are
under
construction
overview
the
broad
objective
of
hpcd
is
to
build
on
top
of
advances
in
massively
parallel
computing
hypercomputing
in
computational
science
in
ai
and
in
modeling
simulation
technology
and
to
develop
a
new
generation
of
engineering
automation
technology
that
can
bring
about
dramatic
gains
in
productivity
of
the
national
industrial
base
the
top
level
goal
is
to
develop
hypercomputing
methods
for
attaining
order
of
magnitude
speedups
in
the
time
required
for
transition
from
an
innovative
design
concept
or
and
a
scientific
advance
to
a
useful
high
quality
product
the
focus
of
the
effort
is
on
design
of
complex
engineering
systems
such
as
computers
ships
jet
engines
where
the
design
process
is
strongly
dependent
upon
the
use
of
knowledge
from
several
scientific
disciplines
the
main
technical
goals
of
the
project
are
as
follows
to
develop
methods
that
use
hypercomputing
power
in
conjunction
with
scientific
knowledge
in
a
domain
ai
and
visiometric
techniques
in
order
to
build
computational
models
and
related
simulations
in
the
domain
that
range
from
the
highly
accurate
but
costly
models
needed
for
scientific
discovery
and
design
verification
to
the
greatly
reduced
and
approximate
but
cheap
models
needed
to
explore
large
spaces
of
design
alternatives
to
develop
methods
and
tools
based
on
ai
and
other
related
areas
of
computer
and
computational
science
to
help
in
the
setup
and
control
of
complex
simulations
and
the
automatic
analysis
and
interpretation
of
massive
datasets
produced
from
simulation
runs
to
develop
methods
and
tools
that
use
computational
models
efficiently
to
manage
control
the
formulation
and
solution
of
complex
design
problems
hpcd
is
an
arpa
ito
sponsored
project
within
the
framework
of
the
national
hpcc
program
the
project
is
intended
as
a
major
step
towards
building
a
comprehensive
national
resource
for
hpc
based
computational
methods
and
facilities
that
can
address
the
grand
challenge
of
design
the
project
is
organized
as
a
large
scale
multidisciplinary
multi
institutional
consortium
involving
researchers
from
academia
and
industry
participating
universities

the
component
efforts
of
hpcd
are
designed
to
address
the
three
main
technical
goals
of
the
project
by
proceeding
bottom
up
via
exploration
of
selected
concrete
design
problems
and
by
developing
methodologies
and
tools
in
a
manner
which
is
strongly
influenced
by
the
pull
of
these
problems
to
achieve
cohesion
in
the
overall
res
arch
effort
the
component
efforts
are
organized
in
two
main
clusters
cluster

concentrating
on
design
and
manufacturing
of
computers
and
of
related
microstructures
and
cluster
ii
concentrating
on

are
critically
dependent
on
computational

whose
emphasis
is
on
computer
computational

foundations
and
methodologies
that
are
related
to
work
in
the
two
main
clusters
each
cluster
includes
efforts
in
two
or
three
research
areas
collaboration
among
researchers

here
is
a
new
optional
paper
by
paul
rodriguez
on
context
free
languages
and
simple
recurrent
nets
topics
this
course
provides
an
introduction
to
the
field
of
natural
language
processing
or
computational
linguistics
including
both
analysis
and
generation
speech
processing
machine
translation
and
computational
approaches
to
language
acquisition
and
language
evolution
are
also
given
some
attention
a
wide
range
of
linguistic
phenomena
including
phonology
morphology
syntax
and
semantics
and
pragmatics
will
be
treated
and
examples
will
come
from
various
languages
we
will
be
concerned
both
with
how
well
particular
approaches
solve
practical
problems
and
with
how
well
they
model
human
data
the
course
is
divided
into
two
relatively
separate
components
the
first
deals
with
symbolic
approaches
to
language
processing
we
will
cover
parsing
and
generation
algorithms
emphasizing
modern
unification
based
approaches
but
will
spend
more
of
our
time
considering
the
sorts
of
grammars
that
support
parsing
and
generation
with
respect
to
theory
and
notation
we
will
stick
mainly
with
head
driven
phrase
structure
grammar
probably
the
most
popular
approach
in
computational
linguistics
today
the
second
component
of
the
course
deals
with
statistical
and
connectionist
approaches
to
language
processing
which
despite
their
very
different
origins
and
motivation
share
many
underlying
mechanisms
as
well
as
a
lack
of
built
in
linguistic
knowledge
we
will
emphasize
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
phonological
morphological
syntactic
semantic
temporal
processing
and
the
relation
between
perception
and
the
grammar
lexicon
the
course
schedule
however
will
be
organized
around
topics
rather
than
approaches
thus
we
will
look
at
morphology
approaches
to
parsing
and
semantic
case
for
example
in
each
case
considering
how
both
symbolic
and
connectionist
statistical
approaches
deal
with
the
problem
for
each
topic
we
will
also
look
at
acquisition
as
well
as
processing
coursework
and
prerequisites
students
should
have
some
background
in
ai
such
as
c563
564
and
be
able
to
program
in
scheme
or
lisp
some
linguistics
background
would
also
be
very
helpful
but
is
not
required
cognitive
science
students
from
outside
of
computer
science
are
encouraged
to
enroll
coursework
includes
project
50
this
may
be
done
in
collaboration
with
others
in
the
class
it
should
include
a
running
program
though
this
can
be
based
on
existing
software
in
the
case
of
connectionist
models
and
a
report
which
relates
the
work
to
other
work
in
the
area
an
attempt
will
be
made
to
relate
projects
to
each
other
by
constraining

the
course
provides
an
introduction
to
the
theory
of
computation
the
treatment
is
mathematical
but
the
point
of
view
is
that
of
computer
science
roughly
speaking
the
theory
of
computation
consists
of
three
overlapping
subareas
1
formal

and
automata
2
computability
and

gaggle
theory
gaggle
theory
description
gaggle
and
not
giggle
is
the
pronunciation
of
the
acronym
ggl
for
generalized
galois
logic
this
is
an
algebraic
abstraction
that
covers
most
of
existing
natural
logics
classical
modal
intuitionistic
relevant
linear
bck
lambek
calculus
etc
a
gaggle
is
a
great
generalization
of
the
ideas
of
jonnson
and
tarski
s
boolean
algebras
with
operators
operators
can
distribute
or
co
distribute
in
various
of
their
places
over
either
meet
or
join
and
are
also
required
to
interact
with
each
other
in
a
way
that
generalizes
the
notions
of
galois
connection
and
residuation
the
idea
is
to
give
a
representation
theorem
using
kripke
frames
and
to
interpret
an
n
ary
operator
using
a
n
1
placed
accessibility
relation
as
for
example
necessity
in
modal
logic
is
interpreted
using
a
binary
accessibility
relation
while
the
original
focus
was
gaggles
based
on
underlying
distributive
lattices
the
project
has
been
extended
to
underlying
partial
orders

p
foundations
of

cs
304
p
is
an
introduction
to
computer
science
and
programming
this
section
of
cs
304
p
is
intended
for
cs
majors
who
have
had
at
least
a
semester
of
programming
in
high
school
the
course
number
will
be
changed
to
cs
306
next
year
if
you
have
never
taken
a
programming
course
before
you
should
take
porter
s
section
of
cs
304
p
instead
a
strong
math
background
at
least
through
precalculus
is
required
we
will
use
the
programming
language
scheme
a
dialect
of
lisp
the
scheme
implementation
we
will
use
is
called
gambit
and
runs
on
macintosh
computers
this
course
will
move
faster
than
the
previous
cs
304
p
courses
and
will
emphasize
cs
concepts
more
than
programming
language
syntax
we
will
do
a
lot
of
programming
and
work
hard
while
hopefully
learning
a
lot
and
having
fun

high

synchronization
is
becoming
increasingly
important
several
groups
including
ours
have
demonstrated
in
recent
years
that
software
synchronization
algorithms
can
scale
well
to
very
large
numbers
of
processors
and
that
they
can
avoid
certain
negative
interactions
with
high
performance
scheduling
algorithms
we
are
continuing
this
research
in
several
directions
including
1
mechanisms
for
cooperative
synchronization
and
scheduling
which
minimize
unnecessary
spinning
maximize
processor
locality
and
avoid
contention
for
both
lock
and
non

overview
my
name
is
janlori
goldman
and
i
am
the
deputy
director
of
the
center
for
democracy
and
technology
cdt
cdt
is
a
non
profit
public
interest
organization
dedicated
to
preserving
free
speech
privacy
and
other
democratic
values
on
the
internet
and
other
interactive
communications
media
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
testify
before
you
today
on
behalf
of
cdt
in
support
of
the
need
for
strong
comprehensive
federal
legislation
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
medical
records
one
of
cdt
s
primary
goals
is
the
passage
of
federal
legislation
that
establishes
strong
enforceable
privacy
protection
for
personally
identifiable
health
information
we
believe
that
comprehensive
legislation
that
protects
the
privacy
of
health
information
is
critical
the
public
will
not
have
trust
and
confidence
in
the
emerging
health
information
infrastructure
if
their
sensitive
health
data
is
vulnerable
to
abuse
and
misuse
we
commend
the
efforts
of
chairman
horn
and
representative
gary
a
condit
for
their
leadership
towards
enacting
legislation
to
protect
the
privacy
of
health
information
presently
there
is
no
comprehensive
federal
law
that
protects
peoples
health
records
however
a
louis
harris
survey
found
that
most
people
in
this
country
mistakenly
believe
their
personal
health
information
is
currently
protected
by
law
and
most
people
mistakenly
believe
they
have
a
right
to
access
their
own
medical
information
in
fact
only
28
states
allow
patients
access
to
their
own
medical
records
and
only
34
states
have
confidentiality
laws
federal
privacy
policy
is
urgently
needed
to
address
the
increasing
demands
for
health
information
by
those
outside
the
traditional
doctor
patient
relationship
information
demands
of
insurance
companies
managed
health
care
companies
researchers
employers
and
law
enforcement
are
eroding
the
doctor
patient
confidentiality
that
is
central
to
health
care
cdt
believes
congress
must
act
to
protect
the
privacy
of
personally
identifiable
health
information
so
that
our
laws
will
finally
conform
to
some
extent
with
the
american
public
s
perception
and
expectation
that
their
sensitive
medical
records
are
confidential
technological
innovations
that
allow
medical
records
data
and
images
to
be
transferred
easily
over
great
distances
impacts
our
country
in
significant
ways
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
and
information
superhighway
are
changing
the
ways
that
we
deal
with
each
other
traditional
barriers
of
distance
time
and
location
are
disappearing
as
information
and
transactions
become
computerized
few
relationships
in
the
health
care
field
will
remain
unaffected
by
these
changes
in
the
absence
of
any
congressional
action
the
collection
and
use
of
personally
identifiable
health
information
will
continue
to
occur
within
electronic
networked
environments
without
privacy
protections
but
while
this
information
revolution
may
hold
great
promise
for
enhancing
our
nation
s
health
cdt
and
others
believe
that
personal
health
information
in
both
paper
and
electronic
form
must
be
protected
by
strong
enforceable
privacy
rules
even
useful
technologies
pose
potential
risks
to
privacy
where
an
individual
s
need
to
keep
information
confidential
is
forced
to
take
a
back
seat
in
the
drive
to
lower
costs
increase
efficiency
and
facilitate
health
research
through
automation
last

a

at
the

louis
harris
and
associations
released
their
health
information
privacy
survey
prepared
with
the
assistance
of
dr
alan
westin
a
privacy
expert
at
columbia
university
the
survey
found
that
the
majority
of
the
public
56
favored
the
enactment
of
strong
comprehensive
federal
legislation
governing
the
privacy
of
health
care
information
in
fact
eighty
five
percent
85
said
that
protecting
the
confidentiality
of
medical
records
was
absolutely
essential
or
very
important
to
them
most
people
wanted
penalties
imposed
for
unauthorized
disclosure
of
medical
records
96
guaranteed
access
to
their
own
health
records
96
and
rules
regulating
third
party
access
buttressing
these
findings
another
1992
harris
survey
revealed
that
nearly
ninety
percent
90
of
the
public
believed
computers
make
it
easier
for
someone
to
improperly
obtain
confidential
personal
information
twenty
five
percent
25
of
the
public
believed
they
had
been
a
victim
of
an
improper
disclosure
of
personal
medical
information
a
number
of
studies
have
determined
that
a
federal
law
is
needed
to
protect
peoples
medical
records
georgetown
university
law
professor
larry
gostin
concluded
that
a
federal
preemptive
statute
based
on
fair
information
practices
was
necessary
to
protect
personal
privacy
as
networked
health
information
databases
continued
to
grow
2
in
1994
the
office
of
technology
assessment
ota
issued
a
report
entitled
protecting
privacy
in
computerized
medical
information
which
addressed
the
consequences
of
computerizing
medical
records
on
individual
privacy
in
recommending
comprehensive
federal
legislation
ota
found
that
t
he
expanded
use
of
medical
records
for
non
treatment
purposes
exacerbates
the
shortcomings
of
existing
legal
schemes
to
protect
privacy
in
patient
information
the
law
must
address
the
increase
in
the
flow
of
data
outward
from
the
medical
care
relationship
by
both
addressing
the
questions
of
appropriate
access
to
data
and
providing
redress
to
those
who
have
been
wronged
by
privacy
violations
lack
of
such
guidelines
and
failure
to
make
them
enforceable
could
affect
the
quality
and
integrity
of
the
medical
record
itself
3
the
institute
of
medicine
iom
of
the
national
academy
of
science
released
a
study
that
focused
on
the
risks
and
opportunities
associated
with
protecting
the
privacy
and
confidentiality
of
personally
identifiably
health
data
the
iom
report
recommended
that
congress
enact
legislation
to
preempt
state
laws
to
establish
a
uniform
requirement
for
the
confidentiality
and
protection
of
privacy
rights
for
personally
identifiable
health
data
it
also
suggested
that
congress
create
a
code
of
fair
health
information
practices
to
ensure
the
proper
balance
between
required
disclosures
use
of
data
and
patient
privacy
currently
the
national
research
council
nrc
is
preparing
a
report
on
health
care
organizational
applications
of
privacy
and
security
by
analyzing
the
distribution
and
flow
of
health
care
information
among
patients
providers
and
third
party
institutions
the
nrc
plans
to
issue
its
report
on
organizational
practices
that
support
the
security
and
confidentiality
of
electronic
health
care
information
by
the
end
of
1996
b
misuse
of
personal
health
information
the
unauthorized
disclosure
of
personal
health
information
can
have
disastrous
consequences
see
attached
news
stories
and
editorials
new
york
congresswoman
nydia
velazquez
won
her
house
seat
only
after
overcoming
the
results
of
an
unauthorized
disclosure
her
confidential
medical
records
including
details
of
a
bout
with
depression
and
a
suicide
attempt
were
faxed
to
a
new
york
newspaper
and
television
stations
during
her
campaign
in
another
instance
a
journalist
disguised
himself
as
a
doctor
obtained
the
medical
record
of
an
actress
and
published
that
she
had
been
treated
for
a
sexually
transmitted
disease
more
common
and
in
some
ways
more
troubling
than
the
well
publicized
privacy
invasions
of
public
figures
are
the
consequences
suffered
by
ordinary
individuals
whose
privacy
has
been
compromised
by
the
disclosure
of
medical
information
for
instance
federal
auditors
demanded
the
names
of
patients
seeking
confidential
aids
treatment
at
a
boston
clinic
once
the
auditors
obtained
the
names
they
disclosed
the
information
to
other
agencies
4
the
harvard
community
health
plan
a
boston
h
m
o
admitted
to
routinely
entering
detailed
notes
of
psychotherapy
sessions
into
its
computer
records
which
were
then
accessible
by
all
clinical
employees
5
in
maryland
eight
medicaid
clerks
were
prosecuted
for
selling
computerized
record
printouts
of
recipients
financial
resources
and
dependents
to
sales
representatives
of
managed
care
companies
6
even
more
common
are
the
practices
of
some
h
m
os
of
sending
letters
to
employers
detailing
the
health
problems
of
their
employees
surprised
individuals
have
also
discovered
that
personal
problems
they
discussed
with
employee
assistance
program
counselors
became
common
knowledge
among
their
co
workers
7
there
are
a
number
of
other
well
documented
instances
of
breaches
of
health
privacy
8
undoubtedly
there
are
millions
of
similar
breaches
that
occur
either
without
the
knowledge
of
the
individuals
harmed
or
outside
of
the
media
s
spotlight
the
need
for
comprehensive
federal
legislation
becomes
more
imperative
as
the
u
s
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
recently
ruled
that
an
employer
s
right
to
access
their
employee
s
health
records
outweighed
the
employee
s
right
to
privacy
in
their
health
information
in
doe
v
southeastern
pennsylvania
transportation
authority
9
the
court
overturned
a
125
000
jury
s
award
to
an
employee
who
was
taking
the
antiviral
drug
azt
and
whose
infection
with
hiv
became
known
to
co
workers
due
to
a
breach
in
confidentiality
of
the
employer
s
prescription
drug
benefits
plan
while
the
court
agreed
that
employees
have
a
constitutional
privacy
right
in
their
prescription
drug
plan
records
it
found
the
right
was
limited
by
their
employer
s
interest
in
monitoring
such
plans
to
determine
fraud
drug
abuse
and
excessive
costs
the
majority
s
decision
rested
on
the
fact
that
this
employee
suffered
no
adverse
employment
action
such
as
harassment
or
demotion
as
a
result
of
the
unauthorized
disclosure
dissenting
in
the
decision
judge
lewis
stated
quot
i
hope
i
am
wrong
but
i
predict
that
the
court
s
decision
in
this
case
will
make
it
easier
in
the
future
for
employers
to
disclose
their
employees
private
medical
information
obtained
during
an
audit
of
the
company
s
health
benefit
plan
and
to
escape
constitutional
liability
for
harassment
or
other
harms
suffered
by
their
employees
as
a
result
of
that
disclosure
quot
10
errors
found
in
medical
records
have
also
been
difficult
to
correct
and
control
for
instance
mary
rose
taylor
of
springfield
massachusetts
was
denied
health
insurance
for
over
a
year
because
of
a
computer
error
at
the
medical
information
bureau
mib
a
database
of
medical
information
used
by
insurance
companies
mib
reported
that
ms
taylor
had
an
abnormal
urinalysis
even
though
she
had
only
taken
a
blood
test
ms
taylor
was
forced
to
go
to
the
insurance
commissioner
of
her
state
to
correct
the
error
and
it
was
only
then
that
she
finally
received
health
insurance
c
consequences
of
not
protecting
personal
health
information
despite
the
public
and
private
horror
stories
about
breaches
of
privacy
many
americans
trust
that
the
information
they
share
with
their
doctor
is
kept
confidential
indeed
the
traditional
doctor
patient
relationship
is
intended
to
foster
trust
and
to
encourage
full
disclosure
however
once
a
patient
s
information
is
submitted
to
a
third
party
payor
or
to
any
other
entity
the
ethical
and
sometimes
legal
relationship
between
doctor
and
patient
evaporates
putting
patient
privacy
at
risk
in
fact
in
a
harris
survey
93
of
those
termed
quot
leaders
quot
including
hospital
ceos
health
insurance
ceos
physicians
nurses
and
state
regulators
believe
that
third
party
payors
need
to
be
governed
by
detailed
confidentiality
and
privacy
policies
within
our
current
health
care
system
many
individuals
engage
in
tactics
to
avoid
potential
threats
to
their
privacy
some
people
routinely
ask
doctors
to
record
a
false
diagnosis
because
they
fear
their
employer
may
see
their
health
records
some
people
withhold
information
from
doctors
for
fear
of
losing
control
over
sensitive
information
in
psychiatric
practices
it
is
common
for
patients
to
ask
doctors
not
to
take
notes
during
sessions
fearing
the
danger
that
such
records
if
in
the
wrong
hands
could
ruin
a
job
opportunity
harm
their
reputation
or
prevent
them
from
changing
insurance
companies
numerous
people
take
the
simple
if
costly
step
of
paying
for
medical
services
out
of
pocket
to
avoid
the
creation
of
insurance
records
even
though
they
are
entitled
to
and
have
paid
for
insurance
coverage
a
few
insurers
have
been
candid
enough
to
concede
that
their
primary
business
relationship
is
with
the
employer
and
not
the
employee
patient
these
insurers
may
be
reluctant
to
disclose
individually
identifiable
health
information
if
requested
by
an
employer
but
they
will
comply
if
pressed
most
patients
of
course
believe
the
fiduciary
relationship
is
between
themselves
and
their
doctors
and
don
t
realize
that
a
third
party
with
no
direct
relationship
to
their
medical
treatment
actually
controls
the
information
it
is
intolerable
to
support
a
system
in
which
an
employer
s
payment
of
a
portion
of
employees
health
care
premiums
amounts
to
employers
unfettered
access
to
employee
s
health
records
advances
in
technology
exacerbate
the
lack
of
uniform
federal
privacy
protection
for
identifiable
health
information
for
example
at
the
state
and
local
levels
employers
insurers
and
health
care
providers
are
forming
coalitions
to
develop
automated
and
linked
health
care
systems
containing
lifetime
health
histories
on
millions
of
americans
the
primary
goals
of
these
projects
are
cost
reduction
and
improved
quality
of
care
state
coalitions
are
attempting
to
address
the
privacy
confidentiality
and
security
of
health
data
by
crafting
internal
guidelines
regulations
and
contracts
in
addition
in
those
states
where
the
automation
of
health
care
information
is
seen
as
a
key
component
of
a
state
s
health
care
reform
package
state
legislatures
and
public
agencies
are
attempting
to
enact
legislation
that
establishes
a
right
of
privacy
in
protected
health
information
these
states
are
also
attempting
to
design
effective
enforcement
penalties
and
oversight
mechanisms
to
monitor
the
information
practices
of
these
newly
created
health
data
systems
while
some
attempts
are
being
made
to
address
privacy
concerns
the
lack
of
a
comprehensive
policy
protecting
individual
s
privacy
across
all
health
care
settings
will
leave
individual
privacy
vulnerable
the
outcome
of
this
piecemeal
state
by
state
approach
to
protecting
the
privacy
and
security
of
health
care
information
will
lead
to
conflict
among
the
states
and
ultimately
set
back
the
overall
goal
of
privacy
protection
relegating
the
protection
of
health
care
information
to
the
states
different
guidelines
policies
and
laws
leaves
individuals
subject
to
differing
degrees
of
privacy
depending
on
where
they
receive
their
health
care
in
some
instances
this
means
that
individuals
traveling
across
county
or
state
lines
to
receive
necessary
medical
treatment
may
lose
their
ability
to
control
how
their
personal
medical
information
is
used
moreover
states
and
local
governments
with
different
rules
governing
the
use
of
health
care
information
may
be
prevented
from
sharing
health
care
information
contained
in
their
systems
with
neighboring
states
that
insufficiently
protect
privacy
health
care
records
in
both
paper
and
electronic
form
deserve
privacy
protection
but
the
vulnerability
of
information
to
unauthorized
access
and
use
grows
exponentially
as
the
computer
makes
possible
the
instant
sharing
of
information
as
a
1992
study
by
the
workgroup
for
electronic
data

quot
the
paper
medium
is
cumbersome
and
expensive
ironically
it
is
the
negative
impact
of
the
paper
medium
that
has
minimized
the
risk
of
breaches
of
confidentiality
although
a
breach
could
occur
if
someone
gave
access
to
health
records
or
insurance
claim
forms
the
magnitude
of
the
breach
was
limited
by
the
sheer
difficulty
of
unobtrusively
reviewing
large
numbers
of
records
or
claim
forms
quot
nevertheless
technology
itself
is
not
the
evil
information
systems
can
actually
be
designed
to
promote
the
confidentiality
and
security
of
personal
information
for
instance
a
well
designed
computerized
system
can
more
closely
guard
individual
privacy
than
paper
filing
systems
the
key
is
to
recognize
technology
s
potential
to
enhance
privacy
not
simply
to
focus
on
the
risks
technology
poses
to
undermine
privacy
there
is
widespread
agreement
among
privacy
and
security
experts
that
protections
must
be
build
in
on
the
front
end
it
is
too
difficult
and
risky
to
enact
them
only
after
a
major
privacy
breach
privacy
and
security
must
regain
their
own
place
as
cornerstones
of
the
medical
relationship
only
then
can
we
achieve
the
potential
for
enhancing
privacy
and
security
iii
principles
for
a
health
privacy
policy
cdt
believes
that
the
following
principles
for
protecting
personal
health
information
must
be
incorporated
in
any
health
privacy
bill
individuals
must
have
the
right
to
see
copy
and
amend
their
own
medical
records
individuals
must
control
the
disclosure
and
use
of
their
personal
health
information
rules
must
be
established
requiring
doctors
insurance
companies
and
other
quot
health
information
trustees
quot
to
obtain
individual
consent
prior
to
the
use
and
disclosure
of
personal
health
information
safeguards
must
be
developed
for
the
use
and
disclosure
of
personal
health
information
all
those
who
are
given
access
to
personal
health
information
must
be
bound
by
comprehensive
rules
that
ensure
the
protection
of
such
information
a
warrant
requirement
for
law
enforcement
access
to
peoples
health
records
must
be
created
and
strict
civil
penalties
and
criminal
sanctions
must
be
imposed
for
violations
of
the
legislation
and
individuals
must
be
given
a
private
right
of
action
against
those
who
mishandle
their
personal
medical
information
without
comprehensive
protections
such
as
these
the
widespread
electronic
transmission
of
records
in
a
framework
of
piecemeal
and
incomplete
protections
will
produce
the
worst
of
both
worlds
confusion
and
red
tape
for
legitimate
data
users
and
debilitating
fear
and
mistrust
for
people
seeking
medical
care
iv
conclusion
cdt
believes
that
the
protection
of
personally
identifiable
health
information
is
critical
to
ensuring
public
trust
and
confidence
in
the
emerging
health
information
infrastructure
health
care
reform
cannot
move
forward
without
assuring
the
american
public
that
the
highly
sensitive
personal
information
contained
in
their
medical
records
will
be
protected
from
abuse
and
misuse
as
the
harris
surveys
indicate
people
are
highly
suspicious
of
large
scale
computerization
and
believe
that
their
health
records
are
in
dire
need
of
privacy
protection
if
people
are
expected
to
embrace
and
participate
in
this
rapidly
changing
health
environment
the
price
of
their
participation
must
not
be
the
loss
of
control
of
sensitive
personal
information
any
system
that
fails
to
win
the
public
s
trust
will
fail
to
win
the
public
s
support
we
risk
having
individuals
withdraw
from
the
full
and
honest
participation
in
their
own
health
care
because
they
fear
losing
their
privacy
congress
should
not
allow
people
to
fall
through
the
cracks
of
the
health
care
system
because
the
privacy
of
their
health
information
is
unprotected
we
urge
you
to
move
forward
with
legislation
that
adequately
protects
health
information
privacy

description
the
purpose
of
this
course
is
to
study
advanced
topics
pertaining
to
compiler
construction
since
cs
431
is
a
prerequisite
to
this
course
a
basic
knowledge
and
understanding
of
compilers
is
assumed
this
course
will
take
a
more
in
depth
look
at
compiler
topics
such
as
various
parsing
techniques
and
grammars
code
optimization
error
recovery
and
type
checking
grading
final
grades
will
be
determined
from
the
following
midterm
exam
30
final
exam
35
programs
30
papers
5
programs
all
programs
for
this
course
will
be
written
in
either

you
can
use
any
machine
you
would
like
access
to
the
department
pcs
or
unix
machines
will
be
given
for
those
who
need
and
desire
it
there
will
be
three
programs
assigned
throughout
the
semester
they
will
be
fairly
time
consuming
and
involved
so
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
you
begin
early
on
them
you
will
pass
off
your
assignments
by
running
them
on
input
that
i
give
you
and
turning
in
the
results
if
you
begin
early
on
the
assignments
and
budget
your
time
wisely
you
will
have
enough
time
to
complete
the
assignments
if
you
don
t
you
probably
won
t
finish
since
late
homework
is
such
a
hassle
to
deal
with
you
will
be
penalized
substantially
for
turning
you
work
in
late
the
late
policy
is
a
10
deduction
the
first
day
late
20
the
second
day
30
the
third
day
40
for
the
fourth
day
50
for
the
fifth
day
and
no
credit
will
be
given
after
that
time
the
first
program
will
be
to
write
a
lexical
analyzer
generator
for
those
of
you
familiar
with
lex
you
will
essentially
be
writing
a
lex
equivalent
the
second
assignment
will
be
to
write
a
parser
generator
like
yacc
the
third
assignment
will
deal
with
compiler
optimizations
papers
you
will
write
two
papers
this
semester
the
first
will
be
due
feb
9
and
the
second
will
be
due
march
30
the
papers
will
be
between
3
and
6
pages
in
length
and
must
contain
at
least
3
bibliographic
references
for
each
paper
you
are
to
take
a
research
topic
in
compiler
construction
describe
the
topic
reference
work
that
has
been
done
in
the
area
and
present
ways
of
improving
previous
work
or
new
ideas
for
solving
the
problem
at
hand
the
purpose
of
the
papers
is
to
familiarize
you
with
current
work
being
done
in
this
field
the
best
way
of
accomplishing
this
is
to
have
you
research
into
the
current
literature
and
become
familiar
with
journals
conferences
and
people
in
this
area

description
in
this
project
we
will
address
the
problem
of
composing
new
collaborative
systems
from
existing
single
user
and
collaborative
systems
we
propose
to
develop
a
new
software
abstraction
called
the
collaboration
bus
that
makes
it
easy
to
compose
collaborative
systems
the
collaboration
bus
will
be
an
extensible
infrastructure
that
provides
general
definitions
of
collaboration
services
default
implementations
of
these
services
rules
for
interconnecting
these
services
and
mechanisms
for
extending
the
set
of
supported
services
the
set
of
generic
services
supported
by
the
bus
will
include
a
a
data
model
for
defining
shared
workspaces
consisting
of
structured
objects
b
a
user
interface
model
that
allows
shared
objects
to
be
manipulated
using
user
interfaces
that
support
text
graphics
audio
video
and
virtual
reality
c
a
coupling
model
that
enables
users
in
a
joint
session
to
share
data
and
user
interface
objects
and
controls
their
interactions
to
ensure
security
and
consistency
contraints
are
not
violated
d
migration
and
replication
mechanisms
that
ensure
that
the
bus
does
not
become
a
bottleneck
and
e
real
time
services
consisting
of
scheduling
algorithms
and
network
protocols
for
ensuring
real
time
coupling
among
the
collaborators
collaborative
session
and
making
users
in
a
session
aware
of
the
previous
work
has
addressed
the
heterogeneity
problem
in
other
domains
such
as
software
engineering
operating
systems
and
database
systems
our
project
will
extend
this
research
by
providing
an
interconnection
technology
for
the
collaboration
domain
it
will
offer
two
forms
of
interoperability
1
inter
service
interoperability
which
will
allow
existing
implementations
of
different
collaboration
services
such
as
user
interface
and
real
time
services
to
be
combined
in
new
collaborative
systems
and
2
intra
service
interoperability
which
will
resolve
inconsistencies
among
different
competing
instances
of
the
same
service
such
as
explicit
and
implicit
schemes
for
creating
joint
sessions
provided
by
different
existing
systems
that
need
to
interoperate
with
each
other
the
following
diagram
illustrates
the
capabilities
of
the
collaboration
bus
click
on
the
picture
to
see
a
bigger
version
the
concept
of
a
collaboration
bus
requires
a
general
abstraction
that
covers
the
functionality
of
existing
collaborative
systems
in
particular
the
bus
must
define
a
reference
model
that
captures
similarities
and
differences
among
multiple
solutions
to
a
problem
in
addition
it
must
provide
when
possible
semantic
translation
to
allow
dissimilar
solutions
to
the
same
problem
to
coexist
it
must
also
define
composition
functions
that
allow
a
service
to
be
composed
with
other
collaboration
services
finally
the
bus
must
not
become
a
bottleneck
that
significantly
increases
the
response
times
of
users
the
following
approach
will
be
used
in
designing
implementing
and
evaluating
the
bus
a
identify
the
services
that
a
collaborative
application
requires
b
identify
a
reference
model
for
each
of
these
services
c
identify
semantics
translations
and
composition
functions
for
each
of
these
services
d
incorporate
into
the
bus
a
default
implementation
of
the
service
and
the
associated
semantic
translations
and
composition
functions
e
develop
mechanisms
and
policies
for
replicating
and
migrating
parts
of
the
bus
f
develop
mechanisms
for
protecting
the
operations
on
the
bus
g
carry
out
interoperability
experiments
involving
each
of
these
services
using
state
of
the
art
existing
software
our
plans
for
the
next
year
are
to
a
identify
potential
clients
of
the
collaboration
bus
and
scenarios
of
how
these
clients
would
interoperate
with
each
other
b
characterize
real
time
requirements
of
collaborative
virtual
environments
based
on
initial
experiments
c
design
version
1
of
the
collaboration
bus
which
will
include
reference
models
semantic
translations
and
composition
functions
for
session
management
coupling
and

important
you
need
to
get
the
new
version
of
tribble
h
as
of
11
4
before
you
compile
the
problem
was
that
the
enumerated
types
were
not
recognized
outside
of
the
class
they
must
be
declared
inside
the
public
section
of
the
class
as
a
result
the
private
section
at
the
top
needed
to
bumped
down
to
the
private
section
at
the
bottom
this
is
shown
in
the
new
version
also
note
the
definition
of
the
randomintinrange
is
defined
in
line
so
that
you
will
not
need
a
corresponding
function
body
in
tribble
cpp
you
can
just
call
it
from
within
the
class
and
it
will
work
in
the
file
prog06
cpp
i
forgot
to
change
the
enumerated
type
values
to
uppercase
you
need
to
do
this
before
you
compile
everything
i
have
changed
the
on
line
copy
of
prog06
cpp
if
you
just
want
to
overwrite
your
obsolete
copy
also
it
used
to
say
include
prog05
h
so
i
changed
it
to
prog06
h
you
might
also
want
to
check
the
help
link
below
again
something
was
added
here
are
some
comments
and
suggestions
for
program
6
it
is
very
important
that
you
use
the
same
name
throughout
program
6
for
the
project
parts
name
of
the
project
directory
name
file
names
etc
i
updated
the
program
description
to
be
consistent
with
prog06
if
you
saw
the
old
version
that
used
prog05
please
make
sure
you
are
consistent
with
your
naming
the
only
discrepency
is
with
the
sample
run
in
chris
weaver
s
public
directory
where
it
is
called
prog05
but
this
shouldn
t
matter
for
your
program
it
is
just
a
sample
program
6
is
on
line
and
ready
it
is
crucial
that
you
read
the
entire
assignment
and
understand
class
basics
before
you
attempt
it
and
that
you
get
an
early
start
it
is
not
hard
but
will
require
some
time
to
piece
everything
together
bring
questions
to

on
tuesday
about
midterm
grades
for
freshmen
you
either
got
a
b
which
means
your

fine
or

it

project
overview
microprocessors
and
memories
are
made
on
distinct
manufacturing
lines
yielding
10
m
transistor
microprocessors
and
256
m
transistor
drams
one
of
the
biggest
performance
challenge
today
is
the
speed
mismatch
between
the
microprocessors
and
memory
to
address
this
challenge
we
predict
that
over
the
next
decade
processors
and
memory
will
be
merged
onto
a
single
chip
not
only
will
this
narrow
or
altogether
remove
the
processor
memory
performance
gap
it
will
have
the
following
additional
benefits
provide
an
ideal
building
block
for
parallel
processing
amortize
the
costs
of
fabrication
lines
and
better
utilize
the
phenomenal
number
of
transistors
that
can
be
placed
on
a
single
chip
let
s
dub
it
an
iram
standing
for
intelligent
ram
since
most
of
transistors
on
this
merged
chip
will
be
devoted
to
memory
whereas
current
microprocessors
rely
on
hundreds
of
wires
to
connect
to
external
memory
chips
irams
will
need
no
more
than
computer
network
connections
and
a
power
plug
all
input
output
devices
will
be
linked
to
them
via
networks
as
will
be
other
irams
if
they
need
more
memory
they
get
more
processing
power
as
well
and
vice
versa
an
arrangement
that
will
keep
the
memory
capacity
and
processor
speed
in
balance
a
single
gigabit
iram
should
have
an
internal
memory
bandwidth
of
nearly
1000
gigabits
per
second
32
k
bits
in
50
ns
a
hundredfold
increase
over
the
fastest
computers
today
off
chip
accesses
will
go
over
1
gigabit
per
second
serial
links
hence
the
fastest
programs
will
keep
most
memory
accesses
within
a
single
iram
rewarding
compact
representations
of
code
and
data
history
the
initial
efforts
of
the
iram
project
were
undertaken
during
the
spring

offerring
of

course
led
by

re
examined
the
design
of
hardware
and
software
that
is
based
on
the
traditional
separation
of
the
memory
and
the
processor
the
course
web
page
contains
a
considerable
amount
of
useful
information
including
copies
of
slides
from
many
guest

as
well
as
the
results
from
three
sets
of
projects
performed
by
more
than
a
dozen
graduate
students
an
earlier

iram
s
large
improvement
in
memory
system
bandwidth
has
significant
potential
for
helpng
configurable
systems
to
achieve
their
full
performance
potential
configurable
systems
offer
improved
performance
by
adapting
processing
capabilities
to
application
specific
needs
but
by
making
the
processing
portion
of
an
application
go
faster
a
conventional
memory
system
will
be
more
and
more
of
a
drag
on
performance
memory
bandwidth
is
also
the
performance
bottleneck
to
rapid
reprogramming

was
that
of

his
research
produced
a
structured

model
which
could
learn
to
categorize
spatial
scenes
with
spatial
prepositions
from
a
variety
of
natural

description
almost
every
course
in
computer
science
uses
concepts
from
mathematics
it
is
the
aim
of
this
course
to
present
many
of
the
mathematical
topics
that
are
frequently
encountered
while
learning
computer
science
those
who
have
taken
c201
using
scheme
know
the
importance
of
recursion
in
programming
we
start
by
examining
in
more
detail
the
concept
of
recursion
in
chapter
2
entitled
iteration
induction
and
recursion
in
preparation
for
study
in
the
analysis
of
algorithms
we
shall
look
at
the
big
oh
notation
in
chapter
3
throughout
mathematics
we
find
that
graphical
representation
of
ideas
make
them
easier
to
comprehend
the
same
is
true
in
computer
science
and
we
next
go
to
chapter
5
to
discuss
special
graphs
called
trees
as
they
are
used
as
a
data
model
in
computing
sets
are
another
important
mathematical
concept
underlying
much
of
computer
science
and
these
are
treated
in
chapter
7
those
who
work
in
database
theory
know
the
importance
of
the
relational
databases
we
next
study
functions
and
relations
from
a
set
theoretic
point
of
view
chapter
9
presents
a
more
general
discussion
of
graph
theory
than
the
previous
discussion
of
trees
logic
underlies
all
of
computer
science
we
next
cover
propositional
logic
which
makes
up
chapters
12
and
14
of
aho
and
ullman
if
time
permits
in
the
last
part
of
the
course
we
shall
investigate
finite
state
automata
a
way
of
modeling
computation
this
material
is
is
contained
in
chapter
10
if
time
permits
we
shall
also
discuss
turing
machines
and
the
halting
problem
note
that
we
have
skipped
many
of
the
chapters
in
our
text
we
shall
also
skip
over
many
of
the
sections
within
chapters
this
text
is
designed
for
a
year
long
course
which
introduces
students
not
only
to
the
fundamental
ideas
underlying
computer
science
but
also
to
the
important
data
structures
used
in
computing
it
would
be
nice
to
have
enough
time
during
the
semester
to
cover
the
whole
text
but
since
this
is
not
the
case
and
since
the
material
that
we
skip
is
so
interesting
you
might
consider
reading
some
of
the
sections
or
chapters
we
skip
to
get
a
head
start
for
some
of
the
future
courses
homework
assignments
will
be
posted
to
the
class
web
page
regularly
usually
due
the
next
discussion
section
late
assignments
will
not
be
accepted
please
write
your
solutions
to
the
problems
in
a
way
that
will
be
easy
for
the
graders
to
read
and
understand
presentation
of
the
answers
is
a
significant
factor
in
grading
homework
in
this
course
you
may
discuss
assignments
with
other
students
do
not
assume
this
is
true
in
all
your
courses
we
expect
you
to
actually
think
through
and
fully
understand
assignment
solutions
we
have
found
that
students
who
copy
someone
else
s
work
and
turn
in
something
they
do
not
fully
understand
usually
do
poorly
on
the
examinations
which
carry
much
more
weight
in
grading
teamwork
in
doing
assignments
is
good
as
long
as
each
member
of
the
team
contributes
and
fully
understands
the
assignment
if
you
are
working
with
a
group
please
indicate
it
on
your
homework
papers
if
someone
has
given
you
a
lot
of
help
acknowledge
them
you
will
not
be
penalized
and

will

they

excerpt
welcome
to
cs193e
object
oriented
user
interface
programming
on
the
next
machine
in
your
typical
cs
class
you
focus
your
efforts
on
the
algorithmic
side
of
problem
solving
this
class
deals
with
a
different
type
of
program
complexity
building
programs
to
interact
with
users
the
user
takes
charge
and
the
program
must
appropriately
present
the
application
functionality
handle
user
actions
and
provide
feedback
on
those
events
the
xerox
star
the
apple
macintosh
the
varied
graphic
interfaces
of
sun
workstations
are
all
examples
of
environments
where
applications
must
support
this
user
driven
model
the
user
has
greatly
benefitted
from
the
shift
in
application
design
but
unfortunately
the
programmer
often
pays
the
price
for
this
ease
of
use
investing
months
of
engineering
time
dealing
with
the
myriad
facets
of
the
user
interface
given
that
programmers
don
t
enjoy
pain
and
re
inventing
the
wheel
the
environments
for
application
design
have
been
evolving
to
provide
better
support
for
application
development
large
toolkits
exist
for
the
mac
windows
x
etc
that
assist
in
presenting
a
consistent
interface
and
interaction
with
user
another
trend
is
the
move
towards
object
oriented
programming
object
oriented
programming
has
some
advantages
over
the
traditional
procedure
programming
mode
first
it
increases
the
modularity
of
programs
and
the
likelihood
that
modules
can
be
reused
in
other
programs
without
being
rewritten
from
scratch
second
object
oriented
programming
is
a
natural
framework
in
which
to
program
graphical
user
interfaces
graphics
elements
such
as
windows
and
menus
are
naturally
modelled
as
objects
while
clicking
with
the
mouse
can
be
viewed
simply
as
sending
a
message
to
the
object
under
the
cursor
at
the
time
of
the
click
the
object
oriented
system
bundled
with
the
next
machine
nextstep
represents
the
one
of
the
most
cohesive
object
oriented
ui
toolkits
and
appears
to
the
benchmark
to
which
other
systems
are
compared
for
this
reason
you
will
be
learning
and
using
the
next
to
explore
the
world
of
building
ui
applications
but
more
broadly
the
experience
of
working
in
an
object
oriented
toolkit
and
principles
of
user
centered
design
should
transfer
to
other
ui
environments

vis
ad
data
visualization
based
on
lattices
bill
hibbard
brian
paul
chuck
dyer
we
are
defining
a
foundation
for
data
visualization
based
on
the
idea
that
a
visualization
process
is
a
function
from
a
set
of
data
objects
called
a
data
model
to
a
set
of
displays
called
a
display
model
a
prototype
system
called
vis
ad
has
been
implemented
based
upon
our
ideas
we
are
guided
by
the
following
principles
scientists
develop
mathematical
models
of
nature
and
data
objects
represent
the
objects
of
mathematical
models
mathematical
objects
frequently
contain
infinite
precision
real
numbers
and
functions
with
infinite
domains
whereas
computer
data
objects
contain
finite
amounts
of
information
and
are
thus
approximations
to
the
mathematical
objects
they
represent
computer
displays
contain
finite
amounts
of
information
i
e
they
contain
finite
numbers
of
pixels
their
colors
are
chosen
from
finite
palettes
animation
sequences
contain
finite
numbers
of
frames
etc
and
are
thus
approximations
to
ideal
displays
because
of
the
close
relationship
between
data
and
computation
a
data
model
should
be
appropriate
for
the
data
objects
of
a
computational
model
such
as
a
programming
language
the
purpose
of
data
visualization
is
to
communicate
the
information
content
of
data
objects
in
particular
we
define
expressiveness
conditions
on
the
mapping
from
data
objects
to
displays
such
that
displays
should
encode
the
facts
about
data
objects
and
only
those
facts
a
visualization
system
should
be
complete
in
the
sense
that
it
implements
any
function
from
data
objects
to
displays
satisfying
the
expressivenss
conditions
we
can
define
an
order
relation
between
data
objects
based
on
how
precisely
they
approximate
mathematical
objects
and
we
can
define
an
order
relation
between
displays
based
on
how
precisely
they
approximate
ideal
displays
i
e
based
on
voxel
resolution
etc
these
order
relations
define
lattices
of
data
objects
and
displays
therefore
we
can
model
the
visualization
process
as
a
function
d
u
v
from
a
lattice
u
of
data
objects
to
a
lattice
v
of
displays
we
can
interpret
the
expressiveness
conditions
in
this
context
and
show
that
d
satisfies
the
expressiveness
conditions
if
and
only
if
it
is
a
lattice
isomorphism
we
can
define
a
particular
lattice
us
appropriate
for
scientific
data
objects
these
data
objects
are
built
up
from
primitive
variables
that
we
call
scalars
e
g
time
latitude
radiance
and
temperature
by
tuple
and
array
data
type
constructors
e
g
array
time
of
temperature
is
a
data
type
appropriate
for
a
time
series
of
temperatures
thus
the
lattice
us
contains
the
data
objects
of
a
scientific
programming
language
we
can
also
define
a
particular
lattice
vv
of
displays
in
which
a
display
is
a
set
of
voxels
each
voxel
is
specified
by
a
set
of
graphics
primitives
that
we
call
display
scalars
e
g
a
pixel
s
location
and
size
in
a
volume
its
color
and
its
place
in
an
animation
sequence
we
can
show
that
functions
d
us
vv
satisfying
the
expressiveness
conditions
are
just
the
class
of
functions
defined
by
mappings
from
the
scalars
used
for
primitive
variables
in
data
objects
to
the
display
scalars
that
specify
graphics
primitives
of
voxels
of
course
designers
of
scientific
displays
already
assume
that
primitive
variables
are
mapped
to
graphics
primitives
for
example
given
a
data
object
of
type
array
time
of
temperature
it
is
natural
to
display
it
as
a
graph
with
time
along
one
axis
and
temperature
along
another
the
remarkable
thing
is
that
we
do
not
have
to
take
this
way
of
designing
displays
as
an
assumption
but
that
it
is
a
consequence
of
the
more
fundamental
expressiveness
conditions
we
are
developing
and
implementing
a
system
called
vis
ad
that
allows
scientists
to
experiment
with
algorithms
steer
their
computations
and
visualize
the
data
objects
they
create
in
their
programs
the
lattice
us
defines
the
data
objects
of
the
vis
ad
programming
language
the
system
implements
the
lattice
vv
of
displays
and
data
can
be
displayed
using
any
function
that
satisfies
the
expressiveness
conditions
however
the
implementation
is
not
quite
precise
just
as
data
flow
systems
define
a
user
interface
for
controlling
data
display
based
on
abstraction
of
the
rendering
pipeline
the
vis
ad
system
defines
a
user
interface
for
controlling
data
display
based
on
the
abstraction
of
mappings
from
scalars
to
display
scalars
it
is
possible
to
define
data
lattices
for
the
recursively
defined
data
types
i
e
complex
linked
types
such
as
trees
used
in
general
purpose
programming
languages
and
for

provide
a

laboratory

at
usc
laboratory
for
molecular
robotics
molecular
robotics
is
an
emerging
and
highly
interdisciplinary
field
that
seeks
to
produce
new
materials
and
devices
at
a
nanometer
scale
by
direct
interaction
with
atomic
structures
whereas
conventional
chemistry
relies
on
bulk
phenomena
such
as
diffusion
to
create
self
assembling
structures
molecular
robotics
manipulates
structures
by
applying
external
forces
and
precisely
positioning
atoms
and
molecules
it
is
a
revolutionary
technology
which
attempts
to
provide
fine
control
over
the
structure
of
matter
analogous
to
the
fine
control
we
can
now
exert
upon
the
bits

prerequisites
to
enroll
in
this
course
you
must
have
satisified
the

topics
this
course
is
a
core
requirement
in
undergraduate
computer
science
curriculums
at
most
colleges
its
purpose
is
threefold
first
to
encourage
you
to
investigate
the
nature
of
computation
second
to
further
develop
your
formal
reasoning
and
writing
skills
and
third
to
add
new
techniques
to
your
programming
bag
of
tricks
accordingly
we
will
develop
several
formal
models
of
computation
each
more
powerful
than
the
last
at
each
stage
we
will
prove
some
of
what
our
intuition
suggests
and
sometimes
what
it
denies
about
these
models
we
will
also
see
how
most
models
admit
two
very
different
characterizations
one
of
machines
that
are
able
to
recognize
certain
events
and
another
of
grammars
that
are
able
to
generate
exactly
what
these
machines
recognize
in
particular
we
will
study
regular
languages
regular
expressions
finite
deterministic
and
nondeterministic
automata
context
free
grammars
pushdown
automata
turing
machines
and
more
if
time
allows

the

homework
assignments
when
writing
up
your
homework
there
are
two
goals
you
must
keep
in
mind
first
to
give
evidence
that
you
have
put
real
thought
into
the
problem
and
second
to
convince
the
reader
that
your
solution
is
correct
and
that
you
know
why
as
a
programmer
you
have
some
experience
with
this
sort
of
writing
an
effective
program
must
be
written
for
both
a
compiler
and
a
human
reader
similarly
solutions
to
your
problems
must
be
correct
in
the
sense
of
solving
the
stated
problem
but
they
must
also
be
comprehensible
to
the
grader
as
with
any
writing
the
first
draft
of
a
problem
solution
is
usually
unpresentable
all
of
the
pieces
may
be
there
but
they
tend
to
be
chaotically
assembled
the
single
most
important
thing
you
can
do
to
make
your
solutions
presentable
is
to
rewrite
them
after
you
have
discovered
why
they
are
correct
and
then
to
throw
away
or
at
least
tuck
away
your
initial
draft
remember
scratch
paper
is
cheap
be
careful
to
realize
that
this
emphasis
on
presentation
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
english
is
your
native
language
or
whether
you
prefer
to
write
your
solutions
with
pencil
pen
quill
or
word
processor
a
well
written
solution
starts
by
stating
assumptions
and
then
works
towards
a
clearly
defined
goal
emphasizing
the
overall
direction
and
omitting
the
superfluous
late
policy
in
general
you
will
have
at
least
one
week
to
work
on
a
homework
assignment
and
at
least
three
opportunities
to
attend
my
office
hours
before
that
assignment
is
due
assignments
turned
in
late
for
any
reason
will
be
marked
late
and
will
be
scored
at
60
of
their
face
value
assignments
turned
in
more
than
a
week
after
they
were
due
will
be
scored
at
0
of
their
face
value
that
is
we
will
still
attempt
to
evaluate
them
but
they
will
not
count
towards
your
grade
for
excused
lateness
such
as
illness
and
family
emergency

simple

perhaps
you
will
disagree
about
the
grading
of
a
particular
problem
or
feel
that
an
instance
of
lateness
was
justified
in
order
to
bring
this
to
my
attention
you
must
prepare
a
written
appeal
with
supporting
documents
and
give
it
to
me
during
the
last
week
of
class
i
will
carefully
consider
these
appeals
and
make
reasonable
adjustments
to
your
benefit
when
preparing
the
final
grades
this
is
only
a
mechanism
for
dealing

my

in
a

manner
you
are
always

concerns
if

overview
the
crucial
problem
facing
today
s
high
speed
microprocessors
is
maintaining
high
processor
utilization
in
the
face
of
long
instruction
and
memory
latencies
to
alleviate
this
problem
modern
processors
issue
multiple
instructions
per
cycle
i
e
superscalars
or
interleave
the
execution
of
different
threads
in
different
cycles
multithreaded
processors
ultimately
though
both
techniques
are
limited
by
the
amount
of
parallelism
available
within
a
single
thread
in
a
single
cycle
simultaneous
multithreading
smt
is
a
technique
that
permits
multiple
independent
threads
to
issue
instructions
to
a
superscalar
s
functional
units
in
a
single
cycle
smt
combines
the
multiple
instruction
issue
features
of
wide
superscalar
processors
with
the
latency
hiding
ability
of
multithreaded
architectures
on
an
smt
processor
all
hardware
contexts
are
active
simultaneously
competing
each
cycle
for
all
available
resources
this
dynamic
sharing
of
processor
resources
enables
smt
to
exploit
thread
level
and
instruction
level
parallelism
interchangeably
both
forms
of
parallelism
can
be
effectively
used
to
increase
processor
utilization
our
studies
have
demonstrated
that
simultaneous
multithreading
significantly
improves
processor
throughput
and
performance
on
both
multiprogrammed
and
parallel
workloads
we
have
shown
that
these
performance
gains
can
be
achieved
in
an
architecture
with
only
minimal
extensions
to
modern
out
of
order
superscalar
processors
our
current
and
future
work
includes
investigations
of
fast
synchronization
techniques
enabled
by
smt
we
are
also
conducting
research
in
other

graphics
package
requirements
general
overview
the
objective
of
these
requirements
is
to
allow
you
to
design
and
implement
a
basic
but
useful
three
dimensional
graphics
package
emphasis
is
given
to
fundamental
computer
graphics
elements
that
are
common
to
all
general
purpose
3
d
computer
graphics
packages
this
course
does
not
emphasize
documentation
or
software
design
nor
does
it
emphasize
user
interfaces
these
are
appropriate
subjects
for
other
courses
and
are
of
obvious
importance
the
goal
of
this
course
is
to
allow
you
to
gain
an
understanding
of
the
important
fundamental
algorithms
and
techniques
used
in
computer
graphics
now
a
warning
to
the
wise
concerning
some
things
you
should
do
so
that
you
have
a
pleasant
experience
in
this
course
first
scan
ahead
and
read
all
parts
of
the
text
that
have
something
to
do
with
your
implementation
this
saves
you
from
realizing
down
the
road
that
the
architecture
of
your
package
cannot
easily
accommodate
a
new
capability
that
must
be
incorporated
understand
all
the
elements
and
how
they
will
fit
together
from
the
start
design
your
package
ahead
of
time
this
task
though
time
consuming
saves
you
a
lot
of
headaches
later
on
there
simply
is
not
enough
time
in
the
semester
to
finish
your
package
if
you
wait
until
a
concept
is
discussed
in
class
before
you
begin
to
think
about
it
or
to
implement
it
while
this
philosophy
may
be
odd
to
some
this
is
the
only
way
you
can
produce
a
good
package
in
this
class
given
the
unavoidable
time
constraints
common
to
university
courses
and
to
actual
production
environments
second
start
early
the
pass
off
deadlines
come
up
very
fast
try
always
to
keep
a
couple
of
weeks
ahead
so
that
you
aren
t
caught
short
and
so
that
you
have
time
left
at
the
end
of
the
semester
to
meet
your
other
responsibilities
third
make
your
code
robust
use
good
sense
and
your
knowledge
of
good
program
design
finally
do
not
limit
yourself
to
the
course
textbook
read
other
texts
and
any
other
material
that
may
give
more
information
on
a
subject
or
explain
it
better
other
sources
can
be
of
great
value
to
you
for
your
implementation
machines
and
languages
students
may
use
any
machines
or
languages
that
are
capable
of
accommodating
the
package
requirements
and
to
which
they
have
authorized
access
for
cs
455
to
make
pass
offs
manageable
for
the
ta
you
must
pass
off
your
package
on
a
computer
located
on
byu
s
campus
which
you
have
authorized
access
to
if
you
develop
your
package
on
a
computer
at
home
please
make
sure
that
there
is
a
compatible
computer
which
will
run
your
package
on
campus
otherwise
you
will
be
under
the
necessity
of
transporting
your
computer
to
campus
for
each
pass
off
which
might
not
be
convenient
for
you
unless
the
computer
is
a
laptop
the

should

which
you

the
balance

may
be
earned
by
completing
optional

listed
in

you
may
also
propose
additional

which
if
approved
in

there
are
85
points
for

note
that
phase
4
gives
you
three
different
options
to

each
option
is
worth
85
points
choose
only
one
of
them
up
to
20
points
may
be
deducted
for
each
assignment
if
the
interface
does
not
facilitate
adequate
testing
of
the
functionality
for
example
drawing
a
line
must
accept
start
and
end
points
and
any
other
functionality
supported
such
as
width
color
etc
points
will
be
awarded
based
on
the
sophistication
and
elegance
of
the
functionality
use
of
operating
system
graphics
primitives
for
phase
1
primitives
the
only
operating
system
primitives
you
may
use
are
those
that
draw
individual
pixels
or
clear
the
screen
this
restriction
applies
only
to
the
graphics
code
specified
by
this
assignment
for
the
user
interface
you
may
use
any
operating
system
or
library
support
available
to
make
your
job
easier
for
phase
2
and
later
you
may
use
built
in
operating
system
or
library
primitives
that
draw
lines
circles
polygons
etc
so
that
you
can
concentrate
on
implementing
the
higher
level
functionality
called
for
in
the
assignments
resources
many
of
the
options
can
be
programmed
using
only
information
from
the
text
book
following
each
option
the
page
numbers
in
the
text
book
that
cover
it
are
listed
in
parenthesis
for
some
options
especially
in
phase
4
the
text
book
has
insufficient
detail
to
allow
you
to
program
it
without
using
outside
resources
the
reference
books
cited
should
prove
helpful
and
the
library
has
many
other
graphics
books
that
would
be
helpful
also
important
note
not
all
of
the
graphics
books
are
available
in
the
library
on
the
shelf
some
of
the
graphics
books
are
kept
behind
locked
doors
some
of
them
include
cds
or
disks
and
you
have
to
ask
the
librarian
to
get
them
for
you
before
you
can
check
them
out
feel
free
to
come
in
and
see
the
ta
during
office
hours
for
additional
help
the
programming
assignments
for
this
class
are
heavy
and
the
deadlines
come
up
quickly
it
is
important
to
not
get
stuck
and
procrastinate
working
on
the
assignment
until
the
deadline
is
imminent
if
you
reach
a
point
where
you
are
not
sure
how
to
proceed
it
is
much
better
to
get
some
help
right
away
and
get
going
again
rather
than
wait
until
deadline
panic
sets
in
and
it
may
be
too
late
to
catch
up

though
cs611
is
called
advanced
programming
languages
in
the
course
book
it
is
better
entitled
semantics
of
programming
languages
the
goal
of
this
course
is
not
to
conduct
a
broad
survey
of
hi
tech
programming
languages
like
c
java
or
sml
nor
to
directly
study
implementation
mechanisms
for
these
languages
e
g
compressed
dispatch
tables
for
multiple
inheritance
rather
the
goal
of
this
course
is
to
study
the
principles
of
formal
notation
for
describing
computations
and
tools
for
analyzing
and
proving
properties
of
computations
these
concerns
subsume
the
study
of
specific
programming
languages
or
implementation
mechanisms
and
hence
lead
to
a
deeper
understanding
of
programming
specification
logic
mathematics
and
proof
theory
for
example
we
will
study
notations
for
abstractly
specifying
how
programs
compute
operational
semantics
as
well
as
notations
for
describing
what
programs
compute
denotational
semantics
in
turn
the
abstract
but
precise
realization
of
these
notations
will
allow
us
to
study
techniques
induction
logical
relations
for
formally
proving
interesting
and
relevant
properties
of
programming
languages
e
g
type
safety
or
compiler
correctness
ideally
a
student
coming
out
of
this
course
will
have
learned
something
about
how
to
make
informal
concepts
and
notation
precise
and
how
to
manipulate
the
notation
to
demonstrate
useful
properties

there
is
now
so

material
in
computational
geometry
that
probably
a

we
can
cover
lots

for
the
course
is
a
reader
comprised
of
a
number
of
survey
articles
plus
lecture
notes
scribed
with
the
help
of
students
in
previous

is
a
preprint
of
the
forthcoming
book
computational
geometry
by
example
by
mark
de
berg
mark
van
kreveld
mark
overmars
and
otfried
schwarzkopf
this
book
uses
examples
from
application
areas
to
motivate
all
the
main
structures
and
techniques
of
computational
geometry
and
may
become
the
main
text
for
this
course
in
future
years
these
two
readers
are
available
at
the
stanford
bookstore
homeworks
exams
grading
etc
the
course
will
have
three
substantial
and
mathematically
challenging
homeworks
of
the
pencil
and
paper
type
there
will
be
no
final
exam
but
there
will
be
a
midterm
whose
function
will
be
to
test
breath
but
not
depth
for
the
final
grade
we
will
count
each
of
the
homeworks
and
the
midterm
as
25
of
the
grade

the
course
provides
an
introduction
to
the
theory
of
computation
the
treatment
is
mathematical
but
the
point
of
view
is
that
of
computer
science
roughly
speaking
the
theory
of
computation
consists
of
three
overlapping
subareas
1
formal
languages
and
automata
2
computability
and
recursive
function
theory
3
complexity
theory
the
course
will
focus
mostly
on
1
and
2
applications
of
1
to
programming
and
natural
language
specification
and
parsing
top
down
and

parsing
will
be
emphasized

the
intelligent
information
infrastructure
project
seeks
to
develop
an
extremely
general
system
for
distributing
and
retrieving
information
that
will
work
over
major
internet
protocols
the
early
phases
involve
building
automated
tools
for
managing
outbound
and
inbound
communications
flows
for
large
organizations
whether
via
email
distributed
hypermedia
or
other
electronic
media
after
an
initial
phase
of
developing
servers
along
these
lines
the
project
will
turn
to
interactive
tools
for
wide
area
communication
including
a
number
of
approaches
to
natural
language
understanding
the
project
grows
out
of
an
experiment
run
during
the
1992
presidential
election
when
mail
agents
distributed
campaign
information
collected
questions
from
citizens
and
allowed

course
goals
internals
tuning
with
a
touch
of
decision
support
the
study
of
internals
will
touch
on
the
intersection
of
database
system
operating
system
and
distributed
computing
research
and
development
specific
to
databases
is
the
support
of
the
notion
of
transaction
a
multi
step
atomic
unit
of
work
that
must
appear
to
execute
in
isolation
and
in
an
all
or
nothing
manner
the
theory
and
practice
of
transaction
processing
is
the
problem
of
making
this
happen
efficiently
and
reliably
tuning
is
the
activity
of
making
your
database
system
run
faster
the
capable
tuner
must
understand
the
internals
and
externals
of
a
database
system
well
enough
to
understand
what
could
be
affecting
the
performance
of
a
database
application
we
will
see
that
interactions
between
different
levels
of
the
system
e
g
index
design
and
concurrency
control
are
extremely
important
so
will
require
a
new
optic
on
database
management
design
as
well
as
introduce
new
research
issues
our
discussion
of
tuning
will
range
from
the
hardware
to
conceptual
design
touching
on
operating
systems
transactional
subcomponents
index
selection
query
reformulation
normalization
decisions
and
the
comparative
advantage
of
object
oriented
database
systems
we
will
also
discuss
because
i
am
doing
research
in
these
areas
query
processing
and
data
structures
for
decision
support
queries
e
g
how
many
red
mustangs
were
sold
in
new
england
in
the
last
two
months
the
formal
prerequisite
of
this
course
is
database
i
but
some
knowledge
of
sql
and
the
definition
of
third
normal
forms
are
in
fact
sufficient
you
must
like
systems
and
be
interested
in
that
area
where
theory
meets
practice
in
recent
years
this
course
has
been
offered

frequently

methodologies
for
time
optimal
and
memory
optimal
systems
abstract
since
most
time
and
memory
critical
parts
of
scientific
computing
applications
are
usually
concentrated
in
nested
loops
this
research
focuses
on
optimization
algorithms
for
synthesis
of
those
multi
level
loops
the
loop
nests
are
modeled
as
multi
dimensional
data
flow
graphs
mdfg
and
algorithms
taking
advantage
of
the
multi
dimensionality
are
designed
computation
of
a
nested
loop
can
be
visualized
as
the
repeated
executions
of
the
iteration
body
in
a
multi
dimensional
iteration
space
by
considering
the
iteration
space
and
the
iteration
body
simultaneously
the
proposed
transformation
and
optimization
techniques
will
be
able
to
optimize
throughput
and
memory
requirement
at
the
behavior
level
the
proposed
project
will
develop
polynomial
time
algorithms
on
various
graph
models
rather
than
using
traditional
integer
linear
programming
approaches
research
topics
of
this
project
include
1
graph
transformation
and
optimization
techniques
using
the
concept
of
multi
dimensional
interleaving
and
retiming
to
obtain
optimal
throughput
with

increase
of
memory
requirement

java
is
an
curious
mixture
of
extreme
hype
and
sound
technology
this
fall
cs838
is
a
graduate
seminar
that
will
examine
java
including
the
java
programming
language
network
security
design
of
distributed
applets
java
virtual
machines
and
java
implementations
compilers
interpreters
and
special

other

are
both
welcome
and
encouraged
this

will
be
taugh
as
a
research
seminar
first
the
professors
are
not
java
experts
but
expect
to
learning
along
with
the
students
what
you
get
out
of
this
course
will
be
experience
in
studying
and
developing
new
ideas
interactioning
with
colleagues
and
new
insight
into
java
we
only
plan
to
lecture
for
a
few
weeks
to
present
an
overview
of
java
then
students
will
work
on
two
month
long
group
projects
students
will
be
evaluated
on
the
oral

instructional
objectives
teaching
the
terminology
and
concepts
of
software
engineering
teaching
the
fundamentals
of
software
project
management
and
working
in
a
team
providing
experience
with
a
real
industrial
software
engineering
project
teaching
oral
and
written
communication
skills
producing
a
portfolio
this
course
will
study
the
concepts
methods
and
tools
for
the
specification
design
construction
testing
analysis
and
documentation
of
large
software
systems
included
also
will
be
non
technical
topics
essential
to
creating
complex
software
systems
successfully
project
management
effective
oral
and
written
communication
and
group
interaction
these
latter
topics
are
what
most
industrial
feedback
says
are
the
most
important
to
employers
and
are
the
most
often
lacking
in
our
graduates
this
experimental
version
of
cse
403
lasting
two
quarters
will
use
a
real
boeing
project
as
an
example
and
the
participants
will
work
in
one
large
group
there
are
several
reasons
for
trying
this
new
approach
the
first
is
that
one
quarter
is
too
short
for
a
realistic
project
so
students
cannot
learn
enough
about
software
engineering
due
to
class
sessions
being
devoted
to
discussing
and
organizing
the
project
in
the
regular
403
class
the
group
projects
are
also
usually
learning
experiences
about
how
hard
it
is
to
work
in
a
group
but
not
enough
is
learned
about
how
to
work
effectively
together
by
having
one
group
headed
by
the
instructor
disasters
can
be
avoided
and
more
experience
can
be
provided
in
the
correct
way
to
work
together
in
addition
students
will
get
experience
in
requirements
analysis
and
a
real
software
development
that
is
not
possible
in
the
normal
class
setting
at
the
end
of
the
two
quarters
students
will
have
a
portfolio
of
a
real
software
engineering
project
that
they
can
use
in
their
job
search
an
example
of
such
a
portfolio
done
for
the
cmu
software
engineering
institute
s
masters
of
software
engineering
program
will
be
provided
at
the
first
class
meeting
in
the
class
each
student
will
be
assigned
a
specific
role
to
play
that
will
allow
them
to
experience
a
leadership
position
see
attached
list
of
roles
however
everyone
will
participate
in
each
phase
of
the
project
so
they
can
learn
how
to
do
each
part
the
instructor
will

is
essential

research
group
the
real
time
systems
research
group
is
headed
by
prof
aloysius
mok
in
the
past
few
years
we
have
worked
towards
laying
the
groundwork
for
establishing
a
firm
theoretical
foundation
for
real
time
systems
and
also
to
build
design
tools
based
on
this
foundation
our
work
can
be
categorized
into
three
areas
as
follows
specification
and
modeling
precise
formulation
of
real
time
properties
of
systems
analysis
and
verification
reasoning
about

split
c
split

split
c
is
a
parallel
extension
of
the
c
programming
language
that
supports
efficient
access
to
a
global
address
space
on
current
distributed
memory
multiprocessors
it
retains
the
small
language
character
of
c
and
supports
careful
engineering
and
optimization
of
programs
by
providing
a
simple
predictable
cost
model
this
is
in
stark
contrast
to
languages
that
rely
on
extensive
program
transformation
at
compile
time
to
obtain
performance
on
parallel
machines
split
c
programs
do
what
the
programmer
specifies
the
compiler
takes
care
of
addressing
and
communication
as
well
as
code
generation
thus
the
ability
to
exploit
parallelism
or
locality
is
not
limited
by
the
compiler
s
recognition
capability
nor
is
there
need
to
second
guess
the
compiler
transformations
while
optimizing
the
program
the
language
provides
a
small
set
of
global
access
primitives
and
simple
parallel
storage
layout
declarations
these
seem
to
capture
most
of
the
useful
elements
of
shared
memory
message
passing
and
data
parallel
programming
in
a
common
familiar
context
split

all

are
built
using
the
free
software
foundation
s
gcc
and
the

available
on

faster
implementations
are
underway
for
the
meiko
cs

using
the
elan
libraries
and
for
networks
of
workstations
using

it
has
been
used
extensively
as
a
teaching
tool
in
parallel
computing
courses
and
hosts
a
wide
variety
of
applications
split

may
also
be
viewed
as
a
compilation

for

caltech
infospheres
project
bringing
theory
to
the
marketplace
the
caltech
infospheres
project
deals
with
the
theory
and
implementation
of
compositional
systems
that
support
peer
to
peer
communication
among
persistent
multithreaded
distributed
objects
though
our
implementation
of
a
generic
distributed
system
uses
java
tcp
ip
and
the
web
the
ideas
are
directly
applicable
to
any
distributed
possibly
object
oriented
system
that
supports
messages
and
threads
a
key
concern
is
the
development
of
reliable
distributed
applications
by
composing
existing
and
created
software
components
in
structured
ways
we
are
solving
the
problems
and
influencing
the
standards
of
distributed
component
technology
for
the
user
and
developer
for
the
internet
of
the
21
st
century
an
executive
summary
of
the
infospheres
project
is
available
release

b1
of
the
infosphere
infrastructure
ii
is
now
available
the
caltech
infospheres
infrastructure
ii
is
a
distributed
system
framework
that
is
implemented
in
java
it
provides
a
generic
object
model
and
a
variety
of
messaging
models
asynchronous
synchronous
and
remote
procedure
calls
this
system
is
freely
available
so
that
researchers
and
developers
can
develop
lightweight
distributed
systems
that
can
leverage
open
standards
and
the
world
wide
web
caltech
is
developing
methodologies
that
take
advantage
of
the
system
s
design
so
that
reasoning
on
entire
distributed
systems
is
feasible
with
these
methodologies
one
can
say
something
about
the
reliability
completeness
and
robustness
of
a
distributed
system
as
a
whole
the
ii
is
being
extended
to
support
interoperability
with
other
distributed
system
models
and
to
utilize
emerging
standards
in
the
java
domain
because
the
system
is
designed
and
implemented
in
a
generic
manner
the
ideas
algorithms
and
theories
developed
within
the
ii
framework
are
directly
applicable
to
existing
distributed
systems
and
frameworks
the
caltech
infospheres
project
is
part
of
the
compositional

group
of
the

one
approach
to
this
very
old

is
to
treat

from
the
perspective

please
see
me
during
office
hours
or
send
me
e

i
am
not
normally
in
my
office
except
during
office
hours
because
i
do
my
research
from

therefore
if
you
want
to
see
me
outside
of
office
hours
please
make
an
appointment
first
you
can
most
easily
contact

problem
solving
exercises
one
of
the
most
important
skills
you
will
learn
in
this
class
is
problem
solving
good
problem
solving
skills
distinguish
a
good
computer
programmer
from
a
bad
one
it
doesn
t
matter
how
familiar
or
skilled
you
are
in
a
particular
programming
language
if
you
do
not
understand
how
to
solve
the
problem
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
write
a
computer
program
for
it
in
any
language
to
help
you
learn
problem
solving
skills
and
techniques
i
will
assign
weekly
problem
solving
exercises
these
will
be
small
but
non
trivial
problems
which
i
will
give
out
each
monday
you
should
look
at
the
problem
and
think
about
it
during
the
week
and
right
down
the
steps
you
would
go
through
to
solve
the
problem
i
e
the
overall
structure
of
your
program
this
is
primarily
an
exercise
in
general
problem
solving
so
you
do
not
have
to
write
any
fortran
code
though
you
may
if
you
want
to
and
have
time
and
your
solution
algorithm
should
not
even
be
dependent
on
a
particular
programming
language
such
as
fortran
we
will
go
over
the
solution
in
class
the
following
monday

on
which
to
print
once
you
exceed
that
quota
you
must
contact
the
lab
either
by
e

try
to
avoid
those
if
you
can
you
may
also
use
your
home
or

an
overview
of

an
overview
of
pcmdi
the
program
for
climate
model
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
pcmdi
was
established
in
1989
at
the
lawrence
livermore
national
laboratory
llnl
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
our
staff
includes
research
scientists
computer
scientists
and
support
personnel
there
are
several
means
of
communicating
with
pcmdi
mission
pcmdi
s
principal
mission
is
to
develop
improved
methods
and
tools
for
the
diagnosis
validation
and
intercomparison
of
global
climate
models
gcms
what
we
call
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
pcmdi
scientists
also
engage
in
research
on
a
wide
variety
of
outstanding
problems
in
climate
modeling
and
analysis
the
need
for
standards
in
both
modeling
and
analysis
has
become
increasingly
apparent
as
more
complex
models
are
developed
while
the
disagreement
among
models
and
between
models
and
observations
remains
significant
and
poorly
understood
the
nature
and
causes
of
these
disagreements
must
be
accounted
for
in
a
systematic
fashion
before
models
can
be
confidently
used
for
climate
sensitivity
and
predictability
studies
in
support
of
global

research
climate
modeling
infrastructure
pcmdi
staff
members
devote
a
significant
share
of
their
time
to
the
development
of
climate
modeling
infrastructure
examples
include
ongoing
construction
of
documentation
validation
data
and
analysis
tools
and
software
products
designed
specifically
for
global
climate
modeling
and
analysis
the
atmospheric
model
intercomparison
project
amip
as
a
preliminary
contribution
to
model
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
under
standardized
conditions
pcmdi
is
coordinating
the
atmospheric
model
intercomparison
project
amip
on
behalf
of
the
working
group
on
numerical
experimentation
wgne
of
the
world
climate
research
programme
wcrp
in
this
project
some
30
amip
modeling
groups
are
simulating
the
climate
of
the
decade
1979
1988
using
the
observed
monthly
sea
surface
temperature
and
sea
ice
as
well
as
common
values
of
solar
luminosity
1365
w
m

and
atmospheric
carbon
dioxide
concentration
345
ppm
the
participating
models
principal
numerical
algorithms
and
dynamical
physical
parameterizations
are
summarized
in
amip
model
documentation
a
set
of
monthly
mean
standard
output
data
from
each
amip
model
is
archived
at
pcmdi
and
some
amip
modeling
groups
have
also
provided
history
data
at
six
hourly
intervals
analysis
of
the
models
performance
in
comparison
with
observational
data
reveals
their
systematic
errors
while
comparison
of
the
amip
simulations
with
each
other
provides
a
measure
of
current
modeling
uncertainties
more
focussed
analyses
of
the
models
ability
to
simulate
specific
processes
and
phenomena
are
being
carried
out
by
more
than
two
dozen
amip
diagnostic
subprojects
in
which
pcmdi
is
playing
a
supporting
role
the
results
of
this
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
of
the
amip
model
simulations
were
extensively
discussed
at
an
international
amip
scientific
conference
in
may
of
1995
pcmdi
research
pcmdi
scientists
are
conducting
amip
studies
both
independently
and
in
association
with
amip
diagnostic
subprojects
we
are
testing
regional
and
hemispheric
validation
techniques
spanning
synoptic
to
interannual
time
scales
in
an
effort
to
evaluate
the
fidelity
with
which
models
can
simulate
observations
pcmdi
has
extensively
studied
the
effects
of
spatial
and
temporal
resolution
on
climate
simulations
performed
with
the
european
centre
for
medium
range
weather
forecasts
ecmwf
atmospheric
model
and
the
semtner
chervin
ocean
model
in
addition
we
are
examining
the
natural
variability
of
simulated
seasonal
and
interannual
climate
in
studies
of
ensemble
integrations
of
the
ecmwf
model
from
different
initial
conditions
pcmdi
has
conducted
several
exploratory
studies
of
the
use
of
nonlinear
and
common
principal
components
for
model
data
and
model
model
intercomparisons
we
also
are
developing
statistical
techniques
for
detection
of
climate
change
by
external
forcing
such
as
greenhouse
warming
against
the
background
of
internal
variability
of
the
atmosphere
and
ocean
collaborations
pcmdi
scientists
are
collaborating
with
a
number
of
amip
diagnostic
subprojects
some
of
this
work
is
coordinated
with
other
wcrp
wgne
initiatives
such
as
the
monsoon
numerical
experimentation
group
moneg
and
the
gewex
sponsored
project
for

pcmdi
also
is
supporting
the
feedback
analysis
for
gcm
intercomparison
and
observations
fangio
project
through
the
development
of
prototype
diagnostics
to
identify
important
radiative
feedbacks
in
addition
we
are
collaborating
with
the
paleoclimatic
model
intercomparison
project
pmip
for
which
pcmdi
is
providing
data
storage
and
diagnostic
software
pcmdi
computer
scientists
also
have
worked
with
colleagues
at
the
national
energy
research
supercomputer
center
nersc
and
in
the
optimass
project
at
the
lawrence
berkeley
national

lbnl
to
develop
innovative
data
access
translation
and
storage
algorithms
and
software
software

an
important
component
of
pcmdi
s
work
is
the
development
testing
and
distribution
of
software
tools
for
the
access
storage
diagnosis
and
visualization
of
data
a
comprehensive
climate
database
management
system
cdms
is
currently
under
development
at
pcmdi
this
tool
will
provide
efficient
access
of
information
from
both
our
model
and
observational
data
archives
validation
data
because
validation
is
central
to
the
diagnosis
and
intercomparison
of
global
climate
models
pcmdi
is
developing
observational
data
products
as
an
essential
element
of
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
our
current
priority
is
to
accumulate
observational
data
including
especially
reanalyses
from
the
amip
period
of
1979
1988
but
a
longer
term
goal
is
to
acquire
quality
datasets
that
are
generally
useful
for
climate
model
validation
future
plans
during
the
next
few
years
pcmdi
will
continue
its
efforts
to
develop
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
consisting
of
standards
and
software
for
documentation
data
management
diagnosis
visualization
validation
intercomparison
and
exchange
in
cooperation
with
the
climate
community
much
of
this
effort
will
be
directed
to
supporting
the
next
phase
of
the
amip
designated
as
amip
ii
in
the
longer
term
we
will
progressively
shift
our
emphasis
from
atmospheric
models
to
models
of
the
coupled
ocean
atmosphere
system
and
will
support
the
development
of
a
coupled
model
intercomparison
project
cmip
in
cooperation
with
the
clivar
initiative
of
the
world
climate
research
programme
pcmdi
also
will
address
specific
questions
that
are
important
model
related
elements
of
global
change
research
these
include
consideration
of
how
to
most
effectively
control
the
unrealistic
climate
drift
that
is
typical
of
coupled
systems
and
how
simulated
natural
variability
may
be
used
in
the
study
of
climate
predictability
and
the
detection
of
climate
change
on
global
and
regional
scales
this
research
supported
by
a
climate
modeling
infrastructure
will
provide
the
basis
for
the
systematic
application
and
improvement
of
models
and
for
the
comprehensive
evaluation
of
their
ability
to
characterize
future
climate
changes
as
a
result
of
anthropogenic
activities

algorithms
for
quadtree
representation
of
matrices
description
rather
than
decomposing
matrices
into
rows
columns
or
tiny
blocks
we
decompose
them
recursively
into
quadrants
the
array
becomes
a
tree
which
still
might
be
stored
sequentially
and
decompostion
of
the
problem
for
multiprocessing
follows
the
subtrees
we
explore
this
structure
as
an
exercise
of
the
thesis
that
functional
programming
is
ideal
for
multiprocessing
the
resulting
algorithms
are
expressed
in
c
for
better
performance
opportunites
for
new
algorithms
abound
sparse
matrices
have
many
empty
subtrees
and
simple
algebra
there
so
uniform
algorithms
can
be
applied
to
both
sparse
and
nonsparse
problems
search
problems

g
pivoting
steer
by
summary
information
that
decorates
interior
nodes
of
the
tree
under
gaussian
elimination
a
nonsingular
subtree
of
any
order
can
be
eliminated
at
any
step
the
resulting
undulant
pivoting
has
been
developed
for
both
exact
and
floating

decomposition

one
of
the
persistent
themes
in
artificial
life
research
is
the
use
of
co
evolutionary
arms
races
in
the
development
of
specific
and
complex
behaviors
however
other
than
sims
work
on
artificial
robots
most
of
the
work
has
attacked
very
simple
games
of
prisoner
s
dilemma
or
predator
and
prey
following
tesauro
s
work
on
td
gammon
we
used
simple
hill
climbing
in
a
4000
parameter
feed
forward
network
to
develop
a
competitive
backgammon
evolution
function
no
back
propagation
reinforcement
or
temporal
difference
learning
methods
were
employed
instead
we
start
with
an
initial
champion
of
all
zero
weights
and
proceed
simply
by
playing
the
current
champion
network
against
a
slightly
mutated
challenger
and
changing
weights
when
the
challenger
wins
evaluation
proceeds
by
applying
the
network
to
all
legal
moves
and
choosing
the
move
with
the
highest
evaluation
our
results
show
co
evolution
to
be
a
powerful
machine
learning
method
even
when
coupled
with
simple
hill
climbing
and
that
the
surprising
success
of
tesauro
s
program
had
more
to
do
with
the
co
evolutionary
structure
of
the
learning
task
and
the
stochastic
and
reversible
dynamics
of
the
backgammon
game
itself

computer
science
and
engineering
much
of
the
work
of
the
concurrent
vlsi
architecture
group
is
experimental
in
nature
we
build
working
chips
machines
and
programs
to
test
new
concepts
and
gain
insight
in
applying
vlsi
technology
to
information
processing
as
illustrated
by
the
following
examples
our
projects
address
parallel
computer
architecture
and
software
interconnection
networks
special
purpose
processor
design
and
vlsi
design
the
m
machine
is
a
multicomputer
that
will
test
new
concepts
for
controlling
multiple
function
units
on
a
single
chip
efficient
and
flexible
communication
primitives
fine
grain
protection
and
global
memory
systems
the
project
seeks
out
methods
for
exploiting
instruction
level
parallelism
within
a
task
and
among
tasks
on
the
same
node
and
between
multiple
nodes
the
m
machine
consists
of
up
to
64
k
nodes
connected
by
a
high
speed
3
d
mesh
network
each
node
includes
a
multi
alu
processor
map
chip
and
external
memory
a
map
chip
contains
12
arithmetic
units
memory
management
hardware
and
a
network
interface
the
chip
s
target
performance
is
800
megaflops
atomic
send
instructions
provide
efficient
communication
by
transmitting
a
message
out
of
registers
messages
are
removed
from
the
network
and
dispatched
by
programmable
software
handlers
the
memory
system
architecture
provides
a
global
virtual
address
space
in
which
addresses
may
be
translated
into
local
or
remote
physical
locations
synchronization
is
provided
via
tags
on
memory
words
the
address
spaces
of
individual
threads
are
separated
and
protected
using
segments
and
privileged
access
pointers
our
software
research
seeks
to
advance
the
state
of
the
art
in
transforming
a
sequential
application
to
an
efficient
parallel
version
such
transformations
which
are
now
very
labor
intensive
should
be
smooth
and
painless
our
compiler
will
employ
both
user
directives
and
automatic
analyses
to
provide
users
with
precisely
the
control
that
is
needed
at
each
stage
of
the
transformation
this
combination
will
allow
users
to
focus
first
on
algorithmic
concerns
leaving
optimization
to
the
compiler
users
may
then
specify
directives
to
improve
performance
for
the
few
critical
aspects
of
the
program
possibly
using
information
not
available
to
the
compiler
the
reliable
router
is
a
high
speed
fault
tolerant
2
d
mesh
router
vlsi
chip
for
use
in
massively
parallel
processors
we
plan
to
use
the
router
in
parallel
computers
and
in
network
switching
hubs
features
include
network
fault
tolerance
via
a
link
level
retry
plesiochronous
timing
to
avoid
the
need
for
a
global
clock
adaptive
routing
for
fault
and
congestion
avoidance
virtual

for
performance
under
heavy
load
support
for
request

description
multimedia
systems
are
characterized
by
use
of
several
different
methods
of
presenting
data
such
as
voice
motion
video
music
and
text
a
conference
call
between
several
parties
that
use
both
voice
and
video
and
a
playback
of
a
recorded
conversation
are
two
examples
of
multimedia
applications
each
type
of
multimedia
data
has
different
properties
for
example
the
bandwidth
required
for
cd
quality
audio
is
very
different
from
that
required
for
full
motion
video
which
is
different
from
that
of
plain
text
however
a
property
common
to
all
of
these
data
types
is
that
they
are
all
real
time
in
nature
the
applications
send
stream
of
data
that
must
be
used
within
a
time
interval
because
the
data
is
useless
after
that
interval
optimal
scheduling
of
real
time
tasks
on
distributed
and
multiprocessor
systems
is
an
essential
issue
for
multimedia
applications
the
objective
of
this
seminar
is
to
study
the
basic
properties
and
techniques
for
real
time
system
support
for
multimedia
application
we
will
study

a
background
of
several
upper
173
division
courses
particularly
algorithms
would
be
helpful
but
is
not
absolutely
necessary
in
mathematics
students
should
have
taken
at
least
one
course
which
contains
formal
definitions
theorems
and
proofs
linear
algebra
is
usually
such
a
course
there
will
be
some
basic
number
theory
that
will
be
covered
along
the
way
so
students
should
be
comfortable
reading
understanding
and
discussing
mathematical
topics
materials
there
is
no
textbook
to
purchase
we
will
be
using
books
and
journal
articles
from
the
libraries
and
resources
from
the
web
some
of
these
will
be
mentioned
in
class
others
will
be
discovered
by
members
of
the
class
expect
to
spend
some
time
in
the
library
and
see
the
note
below
on
the
bibliography
project
topics
the
seminar
is
about
systems
for
encryption
and
authentication
with
an
emphasis
on
mathematical
foundations
and
algorithms
although
implementations
social
issues
and
legal
questions
are
important
they
are
of
secondary
interest
the
specific
topics
will
depend
on
the
interests
of
the
participants
and
the
available
resources
requirements
and
grading
each
student
will
carry
out
a
research
project
during
the
semester
we
will
discuss
possible
topics
by
the
third
or
fourth
week
of
the
semester
a
proposal
with
a
topic
and
a
list
of
possible
sources
is
due
on

objective
the
objective
of
the
shore
project
is
to
design
implement
and
evaluate
a
persistent
object
system
that
will
serve
the
needs
of
a
wide
variety
of
target
applications
including
hardware
and
software
cad
systems
persistent
programming
languages
geographic
information
systems
satellite
data
repositories
and
multi
media
applications
shore
expands
on
the
basic
capabilities
of
the
widely
used
exodus
storage
manager
developed
at
wisconsin
funded
by
arpa
in
a
number
of
ways
including
support
for
typed
objects
multiple
programming
languages
a
unix
like
hierarchical
name
space
for
named
objects
and
a
unix
compatible
interface
to
objects
with
a
text
field
this
interface
is
intended
to
ease
the
transition
of
applications
from
the
unix
file
system
environment
to
shore
as
existing
unix
tools
such
as
vi
and
cc
will
be
able
to
store
their
data
in
shore
objects
without
modification
basically
a
unix
file
becomes
either
a
single
shore
object
or
the
text
field
of
a
more
complex
object
overview
shore
is
something
of
a
hybrid
system
by
nature
inheriting
characteristics
both
from
object
oriented
database
systems
and
from
file
systems
this
section
briefly
describe
the
basic
features
of
shore
the
paper
shoring
up
persistent
applications
describes
shore
in
much
greater
detail
shore
has
three
major
goals
scalability
support
for
hardware
and
language
heterogeneity
support
for
existing
file
based
applications
when
the
shore
project
began
3
years
ago
these
goals
were
unique
among
the
research
and
commercial
oodbms
community
while
the
odmg
effort
has
also
concentrated
on
providing
some
degree
of
support
for
language
heterogeneity
which
in
turn
facilitates
hardware
heterogeneity
shore
remains
distinguished
by
its
focus
on
scalability
and
support
for
applications
that
depend
on
the
unix
file
system
for
persistent
storage
furthermore
since
the
shore
data
model
sdl
is
basically
compatible
with
the
odmg
data
model
odl
we
expect
that
much
of
the
technology
that
we
develop
can
eventually
be
transferred
to
the
commercial
sector
scalable
architecture
shore
s
software
architecture
is
unique
is
several
ways
first
shore
uses
a
symmetric
peer
to
peer
distributed
architecture
in
shore
every
participating
processor
runs
a
shore
server
process
whether
or
not
the
processor
has
shore
data
disks
attached
the
software
has
been
designed
to
be
scalable
it
can
run
on
a
single
processor
a
network
of
workstations
or
a
large
parallel
processor
such
as
the
intel
paragon
or
ibm
sp1
2
this
design
is
in
contrast
to
the
client
server
architecture
used
by
exodus
and
all
the
oodbms
vendors
while
a
client
server
architecture
is
fine
for
a
design
environment
such
as
is
typically
used
in
software
and
hardware
cad
efforts
it
is
not
scalable
the
second
unique
feature
of
the
shore
architecture
is
its
notion
of
a
value
added
server
by
structuring
the
software
that
runs
in
the
server
with
extensibility
in
mind
it
is
relatively
simple
for
users
to
build
application
specific
servers
for
example
the
paradise
project
is
already
using
the
shore
server
to
build
a
geographic
information
system
for
nasa
s
eosdis
project
we
feel
that
these
two
unique
pieces
of
technology
will
play
a
important
role
in
a
variety
of
future
research
and
commercial
endeavors
for
example
the
digital
libraries
of
the
future
will
almost
certainly
depend
on
the
availability
of
scalable
persistent
object
technology
such
systems
are
going
to
store
retrieve
manipulate
and
transmit
objects
containing
video
and
pictures
as
well
as
text
while
current
oodbms
products
could
be
used
these
systems
are
oriented
toward
dealing
with
gigabytes
and
not
terabytes
of
data
customizability
is
equally
important
the
indexing
retrieval
and
query
processing
mechanisms
needed
for
a
digital
library
are
very
different
from
those
required
for
a
geographic
information
system
language
and
hardware
heterogeneity
objects
in
shore
are
typed
shore
provides
a
single
language
neutral
type
system
that
is
used
to
define
the
types
of
all
shore
objects
this
type
system
is
embodied
in
the
shore
data
language
sdl
which
is
the
language
in
which
shore
object
types
are
defined
sdl
enhances
the
omg
data
model
idl
with
support
for
database
features
such
as
bulk
types
e
g
sets
and
lists
and
persistence
the
provision
of
typed
persistent
objects
simplifies
the
task
of
supporting
heterogeneous
hardware
environments
and
makes
it
feasible
to
support
access
to
persistent
objects
from
multiple
programming
languages
which
is
a
key
objective
of
the
shore
project
as
mentioned
earlier
sdl
is
quite
closely
related
to
odl
the
language
neutral
object
type
definition
language
that
was
recently
proposed
as
a
standard
by
the
oodb
vendor
consortium
odmg
in
terms
of
its
emphasis
however
odmg
has
largely
concentrated
on
providing
a
standardized
interface
to
existing
c
oriented
oodbs
our
focus
is
on
support
for
inter
language
object
sharing
within
a
large
name
space
of
objects
support
for
existing
file
based
applications
a
major
goal
of
shore
is
to
enable
applications
that
currently
use
untyped
byte
oriented
files
for
their
persistent
data
flattening
and
un
flattening
their
data
each
time
it
is
accessed
to
stop
doing
so
such
applications
should
be
able
to
store
their
data
as
typed
structured
objects
for
more
convenient
type
safe
intra
and
inter
program
data
sharing
our
ultimate
hope
is
that
shore
will
displace
byte
oriented
file
systems
such
as
the
unix
file
system
shore
provides
two
major
services
from
a
file
system
standpoint
first
to
support
object
naming
and
space
management
in
a
world
with
many
persistent
objects
shore
provides
a
flexible
tree
structured
unix
like
name
space
in
which
all
persistent
objects
are
reachable
either
directly
or
indirectly
doing
so
gives
shore
users
a
familiar
framework
in
which
to
register
individual
persistent
objects
termed
registered
objects
the
roots
of
large
persistent
data
structures
or
bulk
sets
of
unnamed
objects
termed
anonymous
objects
the
realization
of
this
framework
involves
several
different
kinds
of
shore
file
system
objects
including
directories
pools
which
are
files
containing
anonymous
objects
symbolic
links
and
cross
references
shore
provides
two
mechanisms
to
ease
the
transition
of
legacy
unix
applications
such
as
compilers
editors
and
cad
systems
from
traditional
byte
stream
files
to
shore
first
for
applications
that
can
be
re
linked
shore
provides
a
standard
unix
compatible
file
system
interface
e
g
open
close
read
write
mkdir
chdir
in
order
to
make
access
to
shore
objects
via
unix
file
system
calls
possible
the
definer
of
a
shore
object
type
can
optionally
designate
one
variable
length
byte
string
or
character
string
attribute
of
the
object
as
being
the
object
s
unix
data
programs
that
attempt
to
read
an
object
through
shore
counterparts
of
the
unix
file
system
calls
will
only
see
this
portion
of
the
object
for
legacy
programs
that
wish
to
do
so
without
being
re
linked
it
is
possible
to
nfs
mount
a
shore
file
system
and
access
the
unix
data
contained
in
its
objects
directly
this
makes
it
feasible
for
both
new
and
old
applications
to
access
the
same
set
of
objects
while
old
applications
can
only
access
the
unix
data
component
of
the
object
new
applications
can
define
and
access
other
more
structured
attributes
of
the
object

on
their
own
research
or
on
a
survey
of
a
topic
of
general
interest
others
will
be
expected
to

offered
as
a
1
credit
course
in
both
the
fall
and
spring
semesters
in
order
to
receive
credit
for
more
than
one
semester
students
must
make
at
least
one
presentation
to
the
group
for
every
two
semesters
in
which
they
are
enrolled
for
students
who
have
passed
the
computer
science
screening
exam
this
will
normally
take
the
form
of
a
50
minute
talk
on
their
own
research
for
less
advanced
students
the
presentation
will
usually
consist
of
a
20
minute
talk
either
on
their
own
research
or
on
an
area
of
current
interest
in
ai
graduate
students
from

this
course
introduces
students
to
the
basic
concepts
of
systems
programming
including
system
calls
files
and
i
o
process
management
interprocess
communication
networking
concurrent
programming
and
graphics
using
x
windows
particular
emphasis
will
be
placed
on
the
implementation
of
these
concepts
in
unix
but
other
operating
system
implementations
will
also
be
covered
prerequisites
students
are
assumed
to
be
able
to
program
in
c
and
to
have
a
basic
understanding
of
data
structures
and
assembler
language
programming
grading
there
will
be
two
tests
and
six
programming
assignments
each
of
the
tests
will
count
24
of
the
course
grade
the
program
assignments
will
be
of
varying
weights
depending
on
their
degree
of
difficulty
but
they
will
total
52
there
will
be
no
make

exams
however
there
will
be
an
optional
comprehensive
final
exam
which
can
be
used
to
replace
a
missing

or
project
or
your
lowest
test
or
project

must
be
your
own
work
and
you
are
expected
to

may
receive
as
much
help
as
you
wish
on
the
use
of
the
operating
system
text
editors
debuggers
file
transfer
protocols
and
so
on
you
may
consult
with
other
members
of
the
class
about
interpreting
the
assignment
and
you
may
get
help
in
finding
bugs
but
not
fixing
bugs
but
you
are
not
allowed
to
look
at
or
copy
another
person

design
decisions
with
others
and
you
cannot
show
your
code
to
others
students
found
to
be
in
violation
of
these
guidelines
will
fail

general
project
guidelines
all
projects
should
follow
guidelines
for
good
programming
practices
here
is
my
list
your
program
should
have
a
comment
at
the
top
with
your
name
login
id
a
brief
description
of
what
the
program
is
and
any
special
compiling
instructions
main
should
be
like
an
executive
in
a
company
it
should
not
do
any
work
but
it
should
delegate
work
to
other
functions
most
functions
should
be
short
and
each
should
do
only
one
thing
no
function
should
ever
be
more
than
50
lines
each
function
should
have
a
brief
comment
describing
what
it
does
it
is
not
necessary
to
comment
every
line
and
if
your
code
is
well
written
it
should
not
require
a
lot
of
in
line
commenting
however
you
should
use
comments
to
describe
any
unusual
code
or
hard
to
follow
code
or
complicated
code
and
describe
any
non
obvious
variables
variables
and
functions
should
have
meaningful
names
but
you
can
use
single
letters
like
i
for
loop
counters
and
such
you
should
check
the
return
code
for
any
system
call
that
can
fail
and
have
an
appropriate
error
handler
your
code
should
have
enough
error
checking
so
that
no
matter
what
the
user
does
your
program
will
not
seg
fault
or
loop
forever
or
do
other
strange
things
it
is
very
hard
to
make
your
program
idiot
proof
idiots
are
very
clever
all
code
must
be
written
by
you
and
you
alone
except
that
you
can
use
and
modify
any
sample
code
from
the
text
or
from
class
as
long
as
you

182

the
annual
attacks
on
the
press
reports
are
widely
recognized
as
the
most
comprehensive
and
authoritative
source
of
information
on
press
freedom
violations
internationally
this
latest
report
analyzes
the
state
of
press
freedom
in
101
countries
and
examines
more
than
700
individual
cases
of
journalists
who
were
physically
attacked
imprisoned
threatened
or
censored
in
retaliation
for
their
work
most
of
the
journalists
whose
stories
are
chronicled
in
the
survey
are
not
foreign
correspondents
dispatched
to
distant
wars
but
local
reporters
working
under
corrupt
and
repressive
governments
147
many
american
journalists
drop

dangerous
places
like
bosnia
or
rwanda
stay
a

and
go

for
most
of

prize
winning
essayist
roger
rosenblatt
in
the
preface
among
the
book
146
s
major
findings
for
the
second
consecutive
year
turkey
with
51
reporters
and
editors
in
jail
had
the
worst
record
of
imprisoning
journalists
than
any
other
country
147
the
new
turkish
government
should
demonstrate
its
commitment
to
democracy
by
releasing
our
imprisoned
colleagues
and
abolishing
article
8
of
the
anti
terror
law
and
article
312
of
the
penal
code
which
are
inherently
incompatible
with
press
freedom
148
said
cpj

other
countries
with
large
numbers
of
journalists
in

at
the
close

forty
five
of

confirmed
456

attacks
on

in

shows
how
cpj
took
action
on
behalf
of
hundreds
of
journalists
last
year
through
diplomatic
channels
grassroots
efforts
and
media
campaigns
cpj
brought
international
attention
to
these

of

overview
this
instance
of
the
seminar
will
revolve
around
the
theme
of
distributed
cooperation
among
parallel
program
threads
among
human
users
and
among
information
servers
the
goals
and
meanings
of
such
cooperation
vary
tremendously
but
the
problems
that
arise
in
these
different
contexts
seem
to
recur
we
will
range
over
the
fields
of
parallel
computing
distributed
operating
systems
distributed
databases
hypertext
and
maybe
economics
the
following
three
themes
will
help
us
ground
our
exploration
parallel
computing
on
distributed
systems
threads
synchronization
and
communication
distributed
resource
allocation
in
a
cooperative
environment
e
g
internet
supporting
human
collaborative
work
efficiently
and
predictably
the
final
choice
of
topics
will
depend
on
the
interests
of
the
participants
as
expressed
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
semester
format
a
class
meeting
will
generally
consist
of
a
presentation
and
discussion
of
a
narrow
topic
covering
two
or
three
papers
each
participant
will
give
one
or
more
presentation
with
the
following
duties
in
first
week
of
semester
schedule
a
date
and
topic
of
presentation
email

two

before

paper
for

the
topic
in

then

rapid
rapid
scheduling
and
run
time
support
for
parallel
irregular
computations
this
project
focuses
on
the
study
of
scheduling
algorithms
for
exploiting
data
task
and
loop
parallelism
and
the
development
of
run
time
support
on
message
passing
architectures
the
fast
scheduling
algorithms
we
have
developed
provide
effective
utilization
of
computing
resources
for
directed
acyclic
graphs
iterative
task
graphs
with
and
without
cycles
and
task
graphs
with
data
parallelism
the
main
applications
are
targeted
at
scientific
computations
such
as
sparse
matrix
factorization
arising
from
numerical
solutions
to
nonlinear
equations
adaptive
n
body
simulations
using
the
fast
multipole
method
and
image
processing
we
are
developing
a
run
time
system
called
rapid
which
integrates
automatic
scheduling
techniques
and
efficient
communication
schemes
for
irregular
task
computations
with
mixed
granularities
on
message
passing
distributed
memory
machines
the
system
provides
a
set
of
library
functions
for
specifying
irregular
data
objects
and
tasks
that
access
these
objects
it
extracts
a
task
dependence
graph
from
data
access
patterns
and
executes
tasks
efficiently
on
a
distributed
memory
machine
our
experimental
results
on
cray
t3d
and
meiko
cs
2
indicate
that
the
system
obtains
promising
performance
in
sparse
matrix
problems
for
which
actual
speedups
have
been
hard
to
obtain
in
the
literature
in
particular
using
the
rapid
system
we
have
obtained
good
performance
for
parallel
sparse

gaussian
elimination
with
partial
pivoting

the

experienced
an
exceptional

volume
in
1990
italian
demand
for
pleasure
motorboats
reached
the
peak
of
its
high
development
phase
this
trend
was
even
more
accentuated
by
important
laws
issued
by
the
italian
parliament
which
somewhat
alleviated
tax
burdens
for
pleasure
motorboat
owners
after
this
period
of
astonishing
expansion
the
market
has
entered
a
new
cycle
characterized
by
stability
and
even
an
inflection
in
its
growth
rate
nonetheless
this
has
not

market
demand
in
europe
the
pleasure
boat
market
has
experienced
a
cyclic
growth
which
reached
in
1990
the
peak
of
its
high
development
phase
this
trend
was
even
more
accentuated
on
the
italian
market
after
important
laws
issued
by
the
italian
parliament
in
1989
which
contributed
to
further
boost
its
momentum
in
brief
the
inductive
type
of
personal
income
assessment
for
italian
resident
boat
owners
became
less
substantial
in
addition
the
value
added
tax
one
time
doubled
for
boats
over
18
tons
was
limited
to
boats
over
50
tons
approximately
20
meters
in
length
and
a
new
category
was
created
for
small
boat
owners
which
pay
a
reduced
vat
more
consistent
with
european
levels
thus
a
9
vat
was
applied
to
small
boats
under
3
ton
and
6
meters
and
18
5
kw
a
19
vat
applied
to
hulls
up
to
50
tons
and
a
38
vat
to
hulls
over
50
tons
it
is
understandable
how
these
laws
have
positively
influenced
the
growth
of
the
italian
domestic
pleasure
boat
market
which
chalked
up
an
amazing
increase
of
150
from
1985
to
1990
since
1990
year
end
however
the
industry
has
been
experiencing
a
slightly
weaker
demand
for
pleasure
motorboats
several
factors
have
contributed
to
this
end
including
the
decline
in
the
overall
economy
with
slower
growth
of
personal
income
and
the
reluctance
of
pleasure
boat
consumers
to
take
on
additional
debt
skyrocketing
mooring
taxes
and
lack
of
an
adequate
infrastructure
to
support
pleasure
boating
a
pleasure
motorboat
is
by
far
a
discretionary
purchase
that
can
be
postponed
or
canceled
thus
when
the
overall
economy
weakens
the
demand
for
pleasure
boats
also
declines
the
1991
introduction
of
outrageously
expensive
and
differentiated
annual
mooring
tax
rates
e
g
an
eight
meter
motorboat
currently
costs
approximately
1
000
instead
of
the
previous
160
heavily
contributed
to
dampen
consumer
purchases
many
observers
indicate
that
more
affordable
marinas
and
other
infrastructures
are
also
badly
needed
to
boost
medium
term
demand
nonetheless
u
s
products
strongly
desired
by
italian
dealers
and
distributors
because
of
their
innovations
special
features
and
very
competitive
prices
registered
a
further
increase
of
26
in
1991
sales
to
italy
italian
demand
for
u
s
pleasure
motorboats
is
expected
to
fare
well
in
the
near
future
although
it
is
not
likely
to
reach
the
astonishing
increases
of
the
recent
past

thirty
years
ago
there
was

slightly
decreased
with
10
less

notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
small

far
the
most
popular
or
rather
the
more
affordable

this

a
pleasure
boat
the
dominant
criterior
is
the
safety
factor
for
the
same
reason
that
the
installation
of
two
independent
engines
has
become
a
standard
at
sea
gasoline
engine
powered
boats
thanks
to
the
increased
safety
factor
of
modern
designed
engines
are
also
increasing
their
small
market
share
and
find
favorable
application
in
prestige
high
performance
boats
where
high
speed
high
power
concentration
and
reduced
bulk
are
taken
as
major
design
criteria
outboard
engines
are
of
course
practically
all
gasoline
fueled
d
best
sales
prospects
since
a
pleasure
motorboat
is
considered
a
luxury
item
anyway
it
appears
that
the
sale
of
commodious
boats
such
as
medium
size
cabin
cruisers
and
the
more
popular
small
size
day
cruisers
7
to
8
meters
long
inboard
in
outboards
is
expected
to
keep
up
at
the
same
time
manufacturers
are
expected
to
continue
offering
smaller
units
both
for
logistical
and
economical
factors
to
appeal
to
new
boating
enthusiasts
entering
the
market
however
there
is
a
weak
request
at
the
moment
for
runabouts
regarding
the
engines
the
propeller
system
seems
to
be
still
the
most
popular
and
efficient
system
as
long
as
the
propeller
is
properly
designed
for
the
hull
and
engine
characteristics
waterjets
are
somewhat
increasing
their
penetration
both
in
the
small
and
high
power
segments
while
more
appropriate
for
larger
and
faster
boats
jet
propulsion
is
well
suited
to
small
boats
for
special
applications
such
as
coast
guard
fire
brigades
and
safe
approach
of
populated
beaches
where
efficiency
of
the
propulsion
system
is
of
secondary
importance
in
respect
to
safety
and
practical
factors

situation

domestic
production
the
italian
market
for
pleasure
motorboats
is
split
almost
fifty
fifty
among
foreign
and
domestic
suppliers
there
are
approximately
600
shipyards
in
italy
all
italian
of
which
about
200
cover
70
of
total
italian
sales
among
these
are
renowned
names
such
as
abbate
azimut
baglietto
rio
and
riva
the
remaining
400
are
small
artisan
type
enterprises
italian
shipyards
have
an
average
export
share
of
over
65
of
their
total
billing
but
in
the
high
prestige
segment
this
share
exceeds
90
95
with
some
shipyards
working
exclusively
for
the
export
market
high
technology
style
according
to
the
world
famous
italian
design
of
the
hull
line
and
vessel
interiors
are
the
main
reasons
for
achieving
a
high
share
of
this
market
where
price
competition
becomes
a
factor
of
secondary
importance
the
propulsion
systems
selected
by
italian
shipyards
for
powering
their
pleasure
boats
appear
very
international
italian
engine
manufacturers
are
present
all
along
the
line
with
diesel
and
gasoline
fueled
engines
successfully
exported
all
over
the
world
on
the
other
hand
italian
shipyards
select
the
engine
according
to
customer
and
boatbuilder
requirements
often
selecting
engines
imported
from
the
united
states
germany
sweden
etc
this
makes
import
export
figures
very
high
on
both
sides
italian
engines
used
by
italian
shipyards
are
mainly
inboard
engines
in
the
lower
power
bracket
both
diesel
and
gasoline
to
mention
just
a
few
iveco
aifo
bpm
while
in
the
medium
high
power
bracket
the
swedish
volvo
penta
and
the
american
detroit
diesel
and
caterpillar
have
the
highest
market
share
the
german
man
and
mtu
are
the
most
popular
for
engines
up
to
1000
kw
and
above
used
on
luxury
yachts
in
1990
the
italian
market
demand
increased
approximately
45
with
domestic
production
rising
31
from
previous
year
domestic
sales
surged
39
chalking
up
approximately
210
million
while
exports
rose
27
totaling
367
million
the
slight
inflection
in
the
1991
market
demand
was
strongly
covered
by
foreign
producers
to
the
detriment
of
domestic
ones
whose
production
dropped
an
estimated
16
with
consequent
sales
falling
both
domestically
an
estimated
23
and
abroad

in
1990

totaled
117

for
36
of
the
total

in
1991
they
reached
153
million
covering
half
of
the
italian
market
while
1990
imports
rose
57
compared
to
previous
year
in
1991
they
increased
37
which
is
still
obviously
remarkable
but
less
than
previous
year
due
to
the
slight
inflection
in
market
demand
and
to
the
fact
that
there
was
perhaps
a
readjustment
by
italian
boat
dealers
who
had
an
excess
supply
after
the
large
increases
of
the
past
in
addition
to
u
s
suppliers
which

the
lion

20
less

and
some

association
are
really
beginning
to
fear
what
is
generally
looked
at
as
the
u
s
invasion
of
the
market
because
u
s
pleasure
boat
production
enjoys
such
an
excellent
receptivity
the

market
share
for
the
next
three
years
is
expected
to
keep
up
with
an
estimated
annual
real
growth
of
about
5
it
is
unlikely
however
that
it
will
be
able
to
repeat
the
amazing
performances
of
the
recent
past
in
the
short
term
in
view
of
the
general
recession
currently
affecting

the
consequent
drop

trivial

the

the

factors
for

distribution
business
practices
domestic
producers
usually
sell
directly
to
the
end
users
imported
products
are
generally
retailed
by
distributors
who
carry
a
full
spectrum
of
product
lines
these
importers
tend
to
represent
more
than
one
manufacturer
frequently
three
or
four
each
one
specialized
in
a
specific
product
segment
there
are
presently
approximately
3
000
distribution
outlets
in
italy
the
more
prestigious
yachts
are
sold
through
brokers
as
previously
stated
the
italian
government
recently
announced
that
only
italian
citizens
can
act
as
agents
for
signing
off
on
the
homologation
standards
compliance
documents
this
means
that
factory
personnel
of
non
italian
boat
manufacturers
imported
into
italy
cannot
sign
off
on
the
paperwork
quite
often
it
is
the
italian
dealers
or
distributors
who
signs
off
and
these
people
are
italian
citizens
however
if
the
manufacturer
terminates
the
italian
dealer
or
distributor
that
party
owns
the
homologation
and
may
charge
the
manufacturer
a
royalty
for
import
on
behalf
of
the
new
dealer
or
distributor
alternatively
the
manufacturer
can
go
through
the
expensive
homologation
procedure
anew
the
u
s
national
marine
manufacturers
associatin
nmma
has
made
a
ad
hoc
third
party
available
as
the
required
citizen
homologation
agent
for
any
nmma
boat
builder
who
can
act
on
behalf
of
multiple
boat
companies
meeting
their
requirements
of
italian
citizenship
for
the
agent
but
without
the
downside
difficulties
of
terminating
a
dealer
or

who
acts
as

agent

financing
payments
by

are
usually
in
cash
or
in
maximum
60
days
with
a
letter
of
credit
it
is
very
difficult
to
establish
the
mark
up
imposed
by
local
distributors
importers
as
it
greatly
varies
depending
on
the
type
of
product
since
u
s
products
are
in
great
demand
because
of
their
competitive
consumer
prices
it
is
deemed
that
the
average
mark
up
is
not
very
high
and
that
dealers
prefer
to
rely
on
selling
large
quantities

acquisition

acquisition
of
words
description
how
do
children
learn
natural
language
and
how
could
one
get
a
machine
to
do
this
one
popular
view
is
that
the
task
is
so
daunting
that
the
child
and
the
computer
must
come
with
considerable
knowledge
wired
in
but
it
is
not
clear
how
this
wiring
could
be
implemented
in
a
developing
nervous
system
or
even
what
the
appropriate
knowledge
would
be
an
alternative
is
an
approach
which
starts
with
a
particular
architecture
and
then
acquires
the
necessary
knowledge
in
response
to
input
from
and
interaction
with
the
world
this
project
explores
the
acquisition
of
words
within
this
second
sort
of
framework
focusing
on
their
form
how
words
are
composed
out
of
constituent
morphemes
morphology
and
how
the
primitive
sounds
of
a
language
combine
with
one
another
phonology
the
goal
is
a
general
neural
network
architecture
with
the
capacity
to
learn
words
in
any
language
this
topic
is
tied
to
a
number
of
general
issues
in
cognitive
science
the
origin
of
modularity
the
nature
of
temporal
short
term
memory
the
relation
between
perception
and
action
the
development
of
apparently
hierarchical

the
goal
of
the
brass
research
group
headed
by
john
wawrzynek
is
to
expand
the
set
of
applications
for
which
reconfigurable
computing
is
the
best
solution
we
are
working
towards
this
goal
by
improving
both
reconfigurable
architectures
and
the
compilers
for
them
specifically
we
are
investigating
the
integration
of
processors
and
reconfigurable
logic
we
are
currently
developing
the
garp
chip
which
combines
a
mips
ii
processor
with
a
fine
grained
fpga
coprocessor
on
the
same
die
see
current
projects
we
plan
to
investigate
other
architectures
as
well
this
area
is
being
actively
investigated
by
many
groups
around
the
world
here
is
a
summary
of
past
and
present
efforts
we
are
working
in
cooperation
with
the
iram

there
has
been
considerable
interest
recently
in
employing
simple
observer
behaviors
that
either
make
the
recovery
of
scene
properties
easier
e
g
fixation
or
combine
simple
behaviors
in
order
to
perform
complex
tasks
such
as
navigation
and
obstacle
avoidance
our
work
focuses
on
the
ability
of
an
active
observer
to
control
the
point
of
observation
to
perform
tasks
involving
the
exploration
of
an
object
the
developed
behaviors
that
are
provably
correct
make
simple
motion
decisions
that
are
based
on
the
observed
local
geometry
of
the
scene
and
require
minimal
processing
of
each
image
we
first
consider
the
task
of
recovering
the
local
shape
of
the
surface
at
a
selected
point
our
approach
is
based
on
the
general
observation
that
some
positions
provide
more
information
about
an
object
than
others
the
existence
of
such
special
viewpoints
can
be
exploited
only
if
the
observer
is
mobile
and
has
an
efficient
and
deterministic
strategy
for
reaching
them
we
show
that
the
local
shape
recovery
task
can
be
achieved
using
a
simple
and
qualitative
strategy
for
smoothly
controlling
the
point
of
observation
until
the
viewing
direction
is
aligned
with
a
principal
direction
at
the
selected
point
second
we
consider
the
task
of
deriving
a
global
description
of
an
object
we
formulate
global
surface
reconstruction
as
the
qualitative
task
of
smoothly
controlling
the
point
of
observation
so
that
the
visible
rim
slides
over
a
maximal
connected
reconstructible
region
we
show
that
this
task
can
be
provably
achieved
for
arbitrary
smooth
surfaces
by
attempting
to
maintain
a
well
defined
geometric
relationship
between
the
point
of
observation
and
the
viewed
surface
our
approach
suggests
that
the
ability
to
smoothly
control
the
point
of
observation
can
lead
to
provably
correct
behaviors
for
achieving
both
local
and
global
tasks

overview
computer
science
552
offers
an
opportunity
to
learn
about
operating
systems
by
designing
and
building
various
os
components
in
addition
to
studying
their
conceptual
and
theoretical
underpinnings
an
operating
system
controls
and
operates
disparate
hardware
resources
so
as
to
shield
programs
and
users
from
idiosyncrasies
of
individual
devices
and
from
such
nasty
phenomena
as
concurrency
asynchrony
and
failure
by
hiding
detailed
hardware
features
and
behaviors
the
os
provides
an
interface
that
constitutes
an
abstraction
of
the
hardware
in
this
course
we
will
study
the
design
and
construction
of
major
subsystems
of
an
operating
system
and
examine
some
of
the
core
problems
in
detail
we
will
not
focus
on
the
difficulties
of
integrating
the
various
subsystems
into
a
coherent
whole
as
we
might
do
if
this
were
a
project
course
while
these
difficulties
are
critical
for
a
complete
understanding
of
operating
systems
we
would
risk
excluding
issues
of
fundamental
and
current
concern
from
the
limited
scope
of
attention
available
in
a
course
therefore
the
course
will
revolve
around
weekly
and
bi
weekly
assignments
consisting
of
alternating
design
implementation
and
analysis

overview
as
software
systems
increase
in

the
difficulty
of
assuring
that
they
function

increases
rapidly
a
variety
of
approaches
have
been
proposed
that
have
the
potential
to
enable
development
organizations

individual
developers
to
produce

software
in

no
single
technique
is
capable
of
providing
incontrovertable
proof
that
software
always
behaves
as

in
this

we
will
examine
different
verification
and
validation
approaches
that
are
capable
of
providing
us
with
evidence
of
software
quality
using
a

the

is
broken
up
into
the
following
parts
foundations
of
program
analysis
we
cover
mathematical
preliminaries
how
validation
and
verification
activities
relate
to
other
software
development
activities
we
present
and
discuss
a
variety
of
models
that
are
used
to
represent
and
reason
about
the
possible
behavior
of
a
program
specification
of
intended
program
behavior
how
do
we
say
what
a
program
should
do
while
there
are
a
variety
of
different
specification
formalisms
in
this
course
we
will
focus
on
finite
state
automata
specifications
static
techniques
examine
the
text
of
designs
specifications
or
code
one
can
view
static
techniques
as
a
kind
of
abstract
execution
of
the
program
this
execution
produces
different
kinds
of
output
than
the
normal
program
execution
and
that
output
is
used
to
drive
validation
and
verification
efforts
this
execution
can
be
accomplished
on
a
variety
of
different
substrates
we
will
study
both
manual
techniques
that
use
developers
to
perform
program
analyses
automated
techniques
that
algorithmically
perform
program
analyses
dynamic
techniques
involve
executing
an
implementation
with
respect
to
the
semantics
of
the
language
in
which
it
is
written
validation
and
verification
efforts
are
based
on
observing
the
behaviour
of
the
software
as
it
executes
this
can
include
observing
normal
program
output
as
well
as
probing
the
state
of
the
software
during
different
points
in
its
execution
well
look
at
techniques
based
on
both
of
these
assertion
based
analyses
involve
periodic
checking
of
intended
behavior
during
program
execution
testing
involves
checking
of
software
input
output
relationships
software
processes
that
support
verification
and
validation
provide
an
infrastructure
in
which
quality
assurance
activities
can
be
organized
monitored
and
controlled
software
safety
in
life
critical
systems
is
emerging
as
an
increasingly
important
area
of
quality

concurrency
is
being
used
increasingly
in
distributed
and
parallel
software
along
with
increased
performance
comes
an
increase
in
the
complexity
of
the
already
difficult
problem
of
quality
assurance
we
will
consider
the
impact
of
concurrency
on
both
static

the

it

the

of
this

the

can
play
in
this

a

listed
roughly
in

although
structure
generally
has
an
adverse
effect
on

performance
it
permits
the
use
of
quantizers
with
larger
dimensions
which
usually
results
in
much
better

for
a

complexity
until
now
there
has
been
little
theory
to
explain
the
complexity

tradeoff
of
structured
vector
quantizers
this
project
is
developing
new
methods
for
analyzing
structured
vector
quantizers
one
is
an
extension
of
bennett
s
integral
to
vector
quantizers
it
shows
how
the
mean
squared
error
depends
on
the
distribution
and
shape
of
quantization
cells
another
is
an
asymptotic
formula
for
the
probability
density
of
the
quantization
error
these
new
methods
have
lead
to
the
successful
analysis
of
several
structured
vector
quantizers
including
tree
structured
and
two
stage
quantizers
still
another
is
the
analysis
of
transform
coders
at
very
low
rates
the
insight
gained
from
this
analysis
has
also
led
to
a
new
form
of
two
stage
quantization
called
cell
conditioned
multi

vq
that
has
the
same
low
complexity
advantages
of
traditional
multi
stage
quantization
but
asymptotically
suffers
no
loss
in
performance
relative
to
unstructured

it
has
also
lead

new
model
based
approaches
to
halftoning
are
being
developed
they
use
well
known
models
of
visual
perception
along
with
models
of
printing
that
we
have
developed
one
approach
minimizes
the
mean
squared
error
between
the
perceived
intensity
of
the
continuous
tone
image
and
the
perceived
intensity
of
the
printed
halftoned
image
another
is
an
adaptation
of
the
well
known
error
diffusion
method
to
include
the
printer
model
traditional
approaches
for
example
ordered
clustered
dither
obtain
robustness
to
printer
distortions
such
as
ink
spreading
at
the
expense
of
spatial
resolution
and
the
visibility
of
graininess
in
contrast
our
new
methods
exploit
the
printer
distortions
to
produce
higher
quality
images
than
would
be
obtained
with
rperfects
printers
improvements
due
to
model
based
halftoning
are
expected
to
reduce
the

such
cases

the

of
creating

representations
with
the
dual
goals
of

as

as
possible
in
the
representation
and
accuracy
the
reproduced
images
shall
be
as
similar
as
possible
to
the
original
two
approaches
are
being
pursued
the
first
involves
the
use
of
a
detailed
model
of
the
intermediate
level
human
visual
sensors
to
construct
transform
codes
that
hide
quantization
noise
the
second
involves
the
design
of
lossless
image
codes
based
on
adaptive
prediction
with
new
kinds
of
predictors
and
adaptation
strategies
these
lossless
image
codes
are
intended
for
applications
such
as
medical
imaging
where
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
image
is
required
on
the
other
hand
the
first
project
is
intended
for
more
everyday
applications
where
exact
reproduction
is
not
necessary

and

are

there
are
two
parts
of
this
research
project
the
first
part
deals
with
decoding
algorithms
for
worst
case
interference
in
this
work
we
have
derived
transmission
and
decoding
strategies
that
allows
for
maximum
information
transmission
or
minimum
error
probability
these
strategies
allow
the
transmitter
to
vary
the
transmission
power
pseudorandomly
the
performance
of
a
maximum
likelihood
decoding
algorithm
against
the
worst
case
jammer
can
be
improved
worst
case
interference
is
derived
as
well
as
the
resulting
performance
the
second
part
involves
developing
novel
decoders
and
demodulators
that
achieve
favorable
tradeoffs
of
complexity
versus
performance
within
this
area
a
number
of
current
topics
are
being
investigated
such
as
the
design
of
minimal
trellises
for
block
codes
fundamental
limits
for
decoders
with
a
reduced
number
of

decoding
algorithms

so
on

graduate

v
chang
professor
w
stark
in
this
project
we
are
examining
the
performance
of
spread
spectrum
systems
in
a
faded
channel
the
type
of
fading
is
such
that
in
one
spread
spectrum
system
with
a
relatively
small
bandwidth
the
fading
appears
to
be
nonselective
in
frequency
in
another
spread
spectrum
system
the
fading
is
frequency
selective
the
goal
is
to
examine
the
performance
of
a
direct
sequence
spread
spectrum
system
operating
in
the
presence
of
multipath
fading
with
error
control
coding
the
important
issues
are
the
channels
memory
the
selectivity
of
the
channel
the
synchronization
algorithm
and
the
decoding
approach
these
are
issues
that
are
not
very
well
understood
by
system
designers
presently
our
preliminary
results
indicate
that
for
a
nonselective
channel
larger
spreading
improves
performance
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
more
of
the
received
energy
is
treated
as
interference
rather
than
part
of
a
faded
signal
in
other
words
as
the
bandwidth
increases
the
multipath
channel
becomes
more
resolveable
and
signals
that
were
unresolved
before
can
be
resolved
and
rejected
by
the
processing
gain
of
the
spread
spectrum
system

over
power
lines

the
goal
of
this
research
is
to
investigate
different
alternatives
for
transmitting
data
over
a
power
line
the
power
line
suffers
from
distortion
because
of
the
nonideal
characteristics
of
the
media
this
comes
in
two
forms
the
first
is
due
to
the
attenuation
varying
as
a
function
of
frequency
the
second
form
is
multipath
due
to
reflections
off
of
mismatched
lines
transmitting
data
over
power
lines
using
spread

techniques
can
mitigate
the
distortion
present
in

the

used
over

a
code
which
achieves
this
best
performance
is
said
to
be
exponentially
optimum
for
most
channels
the
error
exponent
is
not
known
and
can
only
be
bounded
in
this

the

is

exactly
for

corrugated

waveguides
play
a
major
role
in

applications
include

phase
matching
in

pulse

grating
coupling
and
optical
filtering
in
many
of
these
applications
the
corrugation
is
periodic
in
an
aperiodically
corrugated
thin

waveguide
however
the
frequency
dependent
coupling
between
waveguide
modes
can
be
used
to
produce
a
filter
which
has
a
specified
spectral

inverse

techniques
have
been
developed
for
designing
such
filters
and
efforts
are
currently
underway
to
fabricate
these
devices
several
new

techniques
are
being
pursued
these
include
an

recently
the
development
of
rare
earth
doped
fiber
lasers
has
received
considerable
attention
these
fiber
lasers
exhibit
a
host
of
desirable
properties
first
they
permit
wide
tuning
ranges
and
short
pulse
generation
because
of
their
broad
emission
lines
second
the
pump
powers
required
for
lasing
are
low
since
the
pump
beam
is
strongly
confined
to
a
small
volume
finally
rare
earth
doped
lasers
offer
better
frequency
stability
longer
lifetimes
and
less
temperature
sensitivity
than
semiconductor
devices
these
traits
make
them
promising
devices
for
telecommunications
sensing
and
spectroscopic
applications
glass
waveguide
lasers
on
planar
substrates
are
a
natural
extension
of
the
fiber
technology
as
opposed
to
a
fiber
it
should
be
possible
to
integrate
monolithically
multiple
components
onto
a
single
glass
substrate
these
components
could
include
distributed
feedback
laser
mirrors
grating
couplers
mode
lockers
and
nonlinear
elements
we
have
fabricated
neodymium
doped
channel
waveguide
lasers
in
special
glass
melts
and
have
demonstrated
the
first
glass
integrated
optic
distributed
bragg
reflector
laser
efforts
are
currently
under
way
to
passively
mode
lock
these
lasers
and
to
extend
theses
results
to
rare
earth
doped
lithium
niobate
hosts
novel
sensors
based
on
this
technology
are
also
under
development

goals
the
proteus
project
is
a
project
of
research
and
development
in
natural
language
processing
conducted
in
the
department
of
computer
science
new
york
university
under
the
direction
of
prof
ralph
grishman
the
basic
research
is
focussed
on
the
automated
acquisition
of
linguistic
knowledge
from
large
corpora
we
are
developing
methods
for
the
acquisition
of
probabilistic
grammars
semantic
relations
between
words
and
selectional
patterns
this
research
is
tied
to
applications

a
clarification
this
course
does
not
have
programming
projects
however
if
you
like
programming
you
should
know
that
algorithms
are
written
as
pseudo
code
and
if
you
are
good
at
them
you
can
turn
them
into
real
code
easily
these
algorithms
are
used
in
many
applications
and
there
are
programs
written
for
them
already
you
may
play
with
those
programs
if
you
like
but
you
will
have
to
know
the
algorithms
to
understand
how
the
programs
work
tentative
course
outline
we
will
first
introduce
analysis
of
algorithms
this
includes
asymptotic
notation
summations
and
recurrences
counting
and
probability
lower
bounds
they
will
not
be
introduced
in
abstract
instead
we
will
discuss
sorting
and
related
algorithms
insertion
sort
mergesort
quicksort
heapsort
median
and
order
statistics
as
well
as
strassen
s
matrix
multiplication
algorithms

we
will
then
discuss
data
structures
they
include
hash
tables
binary
search
trees
red
black
trees
skip
lists
and
augmenting
data
structures
the
last
piece
will
start
the
study
of
algorithm
design
although
some
design
techniques
recurrence
divide
and
conquer
will
have
been
covered
while
introducing
analysis
techniques
part

we
will
then
study

techniques
dynamic
programming
greedy
algorithms
and

techniques
amortized
analysis
these
techniques
will
not
be
introduced
in
abstract
instead
we
will
discuss
problems
such
as
longest
common
subsequence
activity
selection
and
minimum
spanning
tree
this
last
example
will
start
study
of
graph
algorithms
part

description
this
research
covers
two
closely
related
areas
of
collaboration
technology
collaborative
tools
and
infrastructures
in
the
area
of
collaborative
tools
it
is
addressing
the
potential
of
these
tools
for
making
distributed
collaborative
software
engineering
tasks
more
concurrent
thereby
allowing
these
time
consuming
tasks
to
be
completed
significantly
more
quickly
in
the
area
of
collaborative
infrastructures
it
is
addressing
support
for
near
automatic
generation
of
efficient
collaborative
tools
thereby
significantly
reducing
the
tremendous
amount
of
effort
required
to
program
these
tools
manually
these
two
efforts
are
related
since
the
infrastructure
is
being
used
to
build
the
tools
and
the
tools
are
being
used
to
evaluate
the
infrastructure
some
of
the
specific
issues
being
addressed
include
security
consistency
undo
computer
support
for
gathering
software
engineering
requirements
and
asynchronous
software
engineering
meetings
the
research
is
using
an
experimental
method
wherein
the
infrastructure
and
tools
are
being
implemented
and
used
in
case
studies
the
research
results
include
taxonomies
of
collaboration
scenarios
principles
interaction
models
software
abstractions
and
architectures
that
support
these
scenarios
and
evaluation
of
the
infrastructure
and
tools
being
developed

retic
a

based

the
vertebrate
reticulate
formation
description
the
retic
behavioral
controller
was
proposed
in
1968
by
kilmer
mccullough
and
blum
then
forgotten
for
more
than
25
years
this
is
all
the
more
amazing
because
the
original
retic
anticipated
work
in
analog
neural

boltzmann
machines
neuroethology
of
behavior
sensor
fusion
and
the
control
of
android

networks
anfns
proposed
by

are
ideally
suited
to

is
a
sophomore
level
introduction
to
computer
architecture
the
syllabus
gives
an
overview
according
to
how
i
last
taught
the
course
which
was
in
spring
1996
back
then
we
used
a
set
of
lecture
notes
for
the
course
which
are
collected
into
a
camera
ready
pre
book
form
all
of
the
problems
and
solutions
are
given
the
course
notes
are
reproduced
at
the
beginning
of
each
semester
and
are
available
from
the
reprographics
service
in
the
busch
campus
center
for
about
28
00
you
can
take
a
peek
at
the
first
few
chapters
which
have
been
placed
on
line
the
postscript
version
is
also
accessible
from
the
on
line
version
in
case
28
00
is
too
rough
on
your
book
budget
but
don
t
go
printing
the
whole
495
pages
on
our
rutgers
printers
beware
that
a
different
hardcover
textbook
was
used
in
the
summer
96
session
and
fall
96
and
that
i
may
use
that
textbook
when
i
lecture
the
course
again
my
current
plan
is
to
use
the
lecture
notes
as
a
supplement
to
the
textbook
though
you
would
not
be
expected
to
buy
the
whole
stack
we
would
probably
distribute
portions
free
of
charge
in
that
case
online
unix
documentation
for
rutgers
systems
we
will
use
the
rutgers
computing
facilities
for
some
of
the
coursework
have
a
look
at
the
on
line
documentation
for
how
to
use
our
facilities

the
church
project
a
functional
programming
language
using
intersection
types
the
church
project
a
functional
programming
language
using
intersection
types
the
church
project
is
a
boston
based
project
designing
and
implementing
an
ml
like
functional
programming
language
the
input
language
is
currently
based
on
rank
2
intersection
types
while
the
typed
intermediate
language
has
intersection
union
product
sum
and
recursive
types
overview
of
language
intersection
types
are
the
basis
of
the
type
system
for
the
proposed
functional
language
it
is
a
matter
of
research
how
to
limit
and
adjust
intersection
types
to
fit
implementation
needs
the
polymorphism
provided
by
intersection
types
is
different
from
universal
quantifier
polymorphism
ml
like
languages
typically
use
a
restriction
of
the
latter
a
particular
restriction
of
intersection
types
those
of
rank
2
has
been
shown
to
be
flexible
enough
to
provide
elegant
solutions
for
several
well
known
problems
caused
by
universal
quantifier
polymorphism
in
ml
like
languages
we
have
started
the
implementation
of
a
core
language
where
the
input
uses
type
inference
for
rank
2
intersection
types
our
hope
is
that
this
flexibility
will
be
further
demonstrated
as
we
add
new
features
to
the
core
language
pointers

resources

project
organization
the
project
is
organized
into
a

design
meetings
and
an
implementation

the
seminar
is
implementation
driven
project
members
summarize
research
reports
from
the
literature
which
are
directly
relevant
to
the
implementation

a

language
is
being
implemented
in

the

no

upon
since
no

you
are
free

work
together
however
it
is
important
at

time
that
you
be
able
to
write
up

in

one
approach
might
be
to
meet

theory
constraint
statisfaction
description
this
research
is
concerned
with
finding
fast
algorithms
for
constraint
satisfaction
problems
a
constraint
satisfaction
problem
is
one
in
which
a
series
of
constraints
is
imposed
on
a
set
of
discrete
variables
the
task
is
to
find
a
set
of
values
for
all
the
variables
that
satisfies
all
the
constraints
simultaneously
for
example
when
scheduling
traffic
lights
each
light
may
be
in
one
of
only
three
discrete
states
furthermore
there
are
constraints
on
the
states
of
the
traffic
lights
that
require
that
no
two
cross
streets
get
green
lights
at
the
same
time
a
constraint
satisfaction
problem
may
have
thousands
of
variables
and
thousands
of
constraints
constraint
satisfaction
problems
arise
in
diverse
areas
these
include
generating
tests
of
correctness
for
electronic
circuits
understanding
line
drawings
by
computer
solving
combinatorial
problems
and
predicting
the
folding
of
rna
molecules
the
set
of
constraint
satisfaction
problems
is
one
of
the
np
complete
problem
sets
so
it
is
unlikely
that
a
fast
algorithm
for
all
constraint
satisfaction
problems
will
ever
be
found
indeed
brute
force
algorithms
for
constraint
satisfaction
problems
may
be
extremely
slow
nonetheless
algorithms
have
been
found
that
are
fast
for
most
problems
in
certain
np
complete
problem
sets
this
research
is
concerned
with
finding
and
characterizing
the
algorithms
and
problem
sets
for
which
constraint
satisfaction
problems
can
be
solved
quickly
with
the
aim
of
finding
general
algorithms
that
are
fast
over
as
wide
a
range
of
problem
sets
as
possible

genesis
the
logic
and
functional
programming
group
was
formally
established
in
1990
as
an
independent
research
group
under
sfu
s
policy
ac
35
it
is
a
strongly
interdisciplinary
group
comprising
members
from
six
sfu
units
computing
sciences
linguistics
mathematics
centre
for
systems
science
education
engineering
two
ubc
units
linguistics
computinc
sciences
and
from
the
university
of
victoria
and
aizu
university
in
japan
area
logic
programming
is
the
art
of
using
logic
to
describe
knowledge
in
a
more
human
oriented
way
than
is
possible
with
traditional
programming
languages
this
is
achieved
by
describing
a
problem
domain
in
terms
of
facts
and
rules
written
in
a
simple
subset
of
first
order
logic
a
hidden
theorem
prover
can
then
solve
a
particular
problem
in
that
domain
by
deducing
as
needed
further
facts
from
the
facts
and
rules
stored
thus
we
can
program
declaratively
largely
in
terms
of
what
needs
to
be
done
rather
than
of
how
to
do
it
logic
programming
has
become
the
heart
of
the
fifth
generation
computing
project
objectives
the
group
s
objectives
are
to
further
the
state
of
the
art
on
the
theoretical
and
practical
aspects
of
developing
declarative
programming
tools
in
particular
logic
programming
functional
programming
constraint
logic
programming
and
logic
grammars
to
investigate
the
uses
of
these
tools
for
concrete
fifth
generation
computing
applications
and
to
facilitate
result
transfers
and
collaborations
with
other
academic
units
and
with
industry
specific
research
interests
building
on
existing
logic
or
functional
programming
tools
our
group
develops
new
tools
e
g
logic
grammars
investigates
their
theoretical
and
implementation
aspects
and
develops
fifth
generation
software
in
areas
such
as
natural
language
processing
front
ends
to
knowledge
based
systems
analysis
generation
and
translation
linguistic
theory
automation
deductive
databases
knowledge
representation
constraint
logic
programming
hardware
design
probabilistic
systems
and
expert
systems
related
areas
such
as
neural
networks
and
parallelism
are
also
investigated
collaborations
group
members
have
a
solid
record
of
successful
collaboration
with
industry
including
a
record
setting
research
contract
with
ibm
canada
for
generating
machine
readable

messages
a
research
contract
with
the
french
government
for
the
automatic
consultation
of
industrial
catalogues
in
french
and
two
research
contracts
with
the
canadian
workplace
automation
research
centre
in
laval
for

the
group
also

these

are
under
construction
only
the
first
few
sections
are
reasonably
well
indexed
for
browsing
and
the
later
sections
will
change
as
the

goes
along
reading
far
ahead
of
the

is
likely
to
be
an
adventure
i
suggest
that
you
use
this
web
page
with
a
browser
while
using
a
scheme
system
interactively
especially
while
working
through
chapter

the

this
will
allow
you
to
cut
text
out
of
the
document
and
paste
it
into
a
running
scheme
system
there
are
errors
in
this
text
especially
the
later
chapters
that
s
another
reason
to
read
the
html
version
with
a
browser
rather
than
printing
out
a
hardcopy
i
ll
correct
most
of
the
errors
before

the

this
lists
all
of

tersely
describes
what
they
do
for

my

the
horus
project
the
company
of
the
gods
rejoiced
rejoiced
at
the
coming
of
horus
the
son
of
osiris
whose
heart
was
firm
the
triumphant
the
son
of
isis
the
heir
of
osiris
185
the
horus
project
has
developed
a
modular
and
extensible
process
group
communication
system
addressing
the
requirements
of
a
wide
variety
of
robust
distributed
applications
horus
the
son
of
isis
and
of
osiris
was
a
god
whose
attributes
appealed
strongly
to
the
egyptians
from
one
end
of
egypt
to
the
other
because
in
him
every
man
and
woman
saw
the
type
of
what
he
or
she
wished
to
possess
that
is
to
say
renewed
life
and
life
as
opposed
to
death
and
movement
as
opposed
to
inactivity
178
horus
provides
a
framework
for
the
development
of
distributed
applications
based
on
group
communications
a
style
of
computing
that
can
arise
in
fault
tolerant
systems
managed
distributed
systems
applications
that
exploit
data
replication
or
coherent
caching
and
groupware
within
the
overall
horus
framework
a
large
collection
of
system
and
application
protocols
have
been
developed
that
allow
the
application
designer
to
construct
a
communication
module
that
exactly
meets
the
application
requirements
at
minimal
cost
the
horus
project
was
originally
launched
as
an
effort
to
redesign
the
isis
group
communication
system
but
has
evolved
into
a
general
purpose
communication
architecture
with
advanced
support
for
the
development
of
robust
distributed
systems
in
settings
for
which
isis
was
unsuitable
such
as
applications
that
have
special
security
or
real
time
requirements
besides
the
practical
uses
of
our
software
the
project
has
contributed
towards
the
theory
of
virtually
synchrony
a
runtime
model
used
for
our
implementation
of
data
replication
and
fault
tolerance
at
the
same
time
our
software
is
much
faster
and
lighter
weight
than
the
isis
system
horus
exists
as
two
systems
an
initial
version
coded
in
c
which
can
be
used
for
research
purposes
at
no
fee
but
has
restricted
commerical
rights
and
a
new
version
called
ensemble
written
in
ml
but
usable
from
many
other
languages
which
is
available
for
all
classes
of
users
at
no
fee
ensemble
is
actively
under
development
and
we
will
do
series
of
releases
over
the
fall
of
1996
and
spring
of
1997
by
early
in
1997
ensemble
will
be
an
outstanding
environment
for
building
java
based
groupware
applications
that
do
multimedia
conferencing
on
the
web
horus
and
ensemble
are
designed
to
be
platform
independent
and
are
available
for
different
classes
of
workstations
personal
computers
parallel
processors
and
on
next
generation
cluster
environments
using
standard
high
speed
communications
networks
the
horus
effort
collaborates
closely
with
many
other
distributed
systems
projects
including
transis
navtech
and
the
stormcast
and
tacoma
projects
links
to
these
and
other
projects
can
be
found
elsewhere
in
these
pages
of
the
circumstances
under
which
horus
was
begotten
we
gain
a
good
idea
from
a
hym
to
osiris
in
which
the
sorrow
of
his
mother
isis
at
the
death
of
her
husband
is
described
the
goddess
was
greatly
distressed
but
she
was
equipped
with
mighty
words
of
power
and
she
knew
how
to
utter
them
so
that
they
might
have
the
greatest
effect
and
she
set
out
in
search
of
the
dead
body
of
osiris
and
never
rested
until
she
had
found
him
with
her
hair
she
made
light
and
with
her
wings
she
stirred
the
air
as
she
made
lamentation
for
her
brother
osiris
and
at
length
she
brought
his
body
into
a
state
of
activity
and
was
them
united
to
him
thus
she
became
with
child
by
him
and
her
son
horus
was
born
in
a
secret
place
where
she
suckled
him
and
reared
him

this
seminar
will
explore
the
user
interface
database
boundary
especially
in
the
context
of
multimedia
systems
the
goal
is
an
architecture
where
these
separate
components
share
more
by
way
of
common
concepts
and
structures
and
less
through
procedural
interfaces
the
intention
here
is
to
conceptualize
and
implement
multimedia
objects
having
semantically
relevant
structure
amenable
to
querying
and
manipulation
in
contrast
to
current
multimedia
systems
which
lack
the
database
perspective
of
data
independence
and
associated
query
capabilities
and
to
current
databases
which
treat
multimedia
objects
as
blobs
if
at
all
the
seminar
will
develop
prototype
implementations
which
present
diverse
information
such
as
movies
sound
tracks
and
even
traditional
relational
data
within
a
unified
conceptual
framework
and
presentation
environment
this
implementation
will
be
done
by
teams
who
bring
a
variety
of
experiences
to
bear
on
the
multifaceted
issues
which
will
arise

structured

have
been
a
big
source

for
almost
all
of
the
history
of
human
civilization
however
until
recently
information
in
documents
was
not
being
used
propoerly
because
of
poor

of

have
been
introduced
for
creating

documents
but
extracting
the
information
based
on
the
structures
in
the
documents
is
still
not
a
very
simple
issue
and
in
most
cases
it
is
ad
hoc
and
based
on
primitive
word
searches
this
talk
would
introduce
structured

and
discuss
some
of
the
ways
of
extracting

out

some

area

large

present
several

such

require

first
it
will
serve
as
a
guide
for
the

second
it
will
serve
as
a
precise
specification
of
your
project
the
manual
should
have
the
following
sections
which
answer
the
indicated
questions
system
overview
what
does
your

do
what
does
the
user
gain
by
using
your

audience
who
are
the
users
of
your

what
are
the
different
areas
on
the

in
each
area
how
is
each

manipulated
and
how
does
the

respond
to
each
manipulation
what
functionalities
is
the

capable
of
performing
how
does
the

it
is
assumed
that
you
have
taken
c211
here
at
indiana
and
so
are
familiar
with
the
scheme
programming
language
the
particular
skills
needed
are
the
ability
to
program
in
a
symbolic
programming
language
and
the
experience
of
programming
with
recursion

we
will
use

course
description
the
mathematical
foundations
of
computer
science
differ
somewhat
from
from
those
of
the
physical
and
social
sciences
the
study
of
computation
has
two
main
branches
performance
and
meaning
in
formalizing
performance
we
focus
on
combinatorics
and
statistics
whose
foundations
are
included
in
traditional
mathemematics
in
formalizing
meaning
we
draw
more
heavily
on
logic
both
as
a
way
to
express
ideas
about
programs
and
as
a
discipline
for
describing
what
computers
are
and
what
they
do
computation
takes
place
in
a
discrete
digital
domain
where
all
phenomena
ultimately
reduce
to
binary
1
s
and
0
s
to
explore
this
universe
we
need
different
mathematical
tools
than
are
used
by
physicists
and
chemists
we
use
induction
far
more
often
than
differentiation
or
integration
for
example
and
will
see
numerous
styles
of
inductive
reasoning
in
this
course
we
will
also
explore
discrete
mathematical
structures
trees
and
other
graphs
that
are
prevalent
in
computing
the
main
goal
of
the
course
is
to
improve
each
participant
s
ability
to
conduct
a
rigorous
mathematical
argument
that
is
to
do
proofs
one
reason
not
the
only
one
we
look
at
logic
in
this
course
is
for
the
purpose
of
evaluating
proof
narratives
a
central
idea
of
this
course
is
that
doing
a
proof
and
programming
are
pretty
much
the
same
activities
the
better
you
are
at
proving
the
better
programmer
you
will
be
more
important
the
better
computer
scientist
you
will
become

plan
to
follow
the
text
book
except
for
chapters

i
may
have
to
skip
more
chapters
depending
on
our
progress
through
the
material
i
may
also
introduce
some
topics
from
later
chapters
as
we
go
along
there
are
a
few
topics
not
in
the
text
that
we
may
look
at
again
if
there
is
time
in
any
event
i
will
cover
all
the
material
of
a
core
251
course
syllabus
and
supplementary
material
one
or
two
weeks
will
be
devoted
to
each
of
the
chapters
listed
below
supplementary
material
is
or
will
be
included

the
chapter

in
some
cases
this
is
an
evolving

will

permitting
homework
assignments
in
studying
the
textbook
material
you
should
work
enough
exercises
and
problems
in
the
text
to
ensure
that
you
understand
the
material
since
many
of
the
discussions
in
class
will
derive
from
these
exercises
we
should
be
certain
that
at
least
one
individual
has
worked
through
every
one
of
them
so
every
problem
has
assigned
to
it
one
or
two
students
who
are
expected
to
be
able
to
present
the
problem
at
a
class
meeting
these
assignments
are
maintained
in
the
s251
newsgroup
most
homeworks
will
not
be
graded
for
credit
the
purpose
of
these
assignments
is
to
guide
participants
in
preparing
for
the
presentation
of
material
in
the
class
and
to
show
the
kinds
of
problems
that
will
be
asked
on
examinations

presentations
and

with
other
students
do
not
assume
this
is
true
in
all
your
courses
teamwork
in
doing
assignments
is
good
as
long
as
each
member
of
the
team
contributes
and
fully
understands
the
assignment
if
you
are
working
with
a
group
please
indicate
it
on
your
homework
papers
if
someone
has
given
you
a
lot
of
help
acknowledge
them
you
will
not
be
penalized
and
they
will

they
deserve

is
tentative
for
this
honors
class
i
would
like
to
place
greater
emphasis
on
interation

participation
than
on
formal
examinations

the
form
of
participation
is
something
i
would
like
to
discuss
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
class
also
since
i
am
required
to
enter
a
grade
for
each
participant
at
the
end
of

the

are
all
online
on

www
the
first
paper
combines
some
degree
of
vision
a
little
with
some
degree
of
technology
nothing
particularly
ambitious
but
a
description
of
the
state
of
the
art
the
second
paper
is
a
non
technical
piece
that
promotes
the
theme
of
learners
taking
responsibility
for
their
education
something
that
will
be
increasingly
important
in
the
future
the
two
choices
for
the
third
reading
are
papers
that
are
more
sophisticated
than
either
of
the
first
two
the
paper

elaborates
on
the
possibility
of
group

of

the
paper
the

toolkit
describes
in
technical
terms
a
layer
of
internet
infrastructure
that
could
make
it
possible
to

distributed
systems
have
moved
beyond
the
confines
of
academia
and
research
labs
and
are
revolutionizing
the
way
in
which
businesses
governmental
organizations
and
simple
citizens
are
processing
and
collecting
information
current
technological
trends
promise
to
dramatically
increase
the
pace
of
this
revolution
by
enabling
the
design
of
highly
cooperative
distributed
applications
that
go
beyond
the
client
server
paradigm
to
harness
the
computational
power
of
distributed
systems
in
this
new
environment
the
scope
and
emphasis
of
fault
tolerant
techniques
are
about
to
undergo
dramatic
changes
fault
tolerance
will
cease
to
be
an
expensive
feature
required
by
a
handful
of
applications
to
tolerate
exotic
failures
to
the
users
of
a
highly
distributed
information
infrastructure
fault
tolerance
will
translate
to
a
competitive
advantage
guaranteeing
reliable
access
to
critical
information
in
this
talk
we
will
explore
a
new
way
to
design
and
engineer
fault
tolerant
solutions
which
we
call
lightweight
fault
tolerance
the
goals
of
lightweight
fault
tolerance
are
to
require
few
dedicated
resources
and
have
a
negligible
impact
on
performance
during
failure
free
executions
to
scale
its
cost
depending
on
the
severity
and
number
of
failures
that
need
to
be
tolerated
to
integrate
with
applications
in
a
way
transparent
to
the
application
programmer
to
enable
and
support
emerging
applications
that
will
communicate
through
messages
as
well
as
files
to
address

an
algorithmic
parallel
multithreaded
language
and

a

system
that

on

of

cilk
now
provides

and
fault

tranparently

programs
adaptive
parallelism
means
that
the
set
of
workstations
on
which
a
cilk
program
runs
can
grow
and
shrink
dynamically
depending
on
the
availability
of
idle
workstations
and
on
the
amount
of

within
the
program
in

can

the
xfs
file
system
uses
close
cooperation
among
nodes
to
provide
better
performance
and
availability
than
a
single
central
server
in
wide

networks
the
challenge
is
to
provide
good
performance
availability
and
consistency
despite
limited
network
performance
and

the
wfs

system
project
will
explore
these
issues
the
spatial
semantic
hierarchy
for
human
and
robot
cognitive
maps
benjamin
kuipers
human
cognitive
maps
rely
on
several
different
representations
for
large
scale
space
each
with
its
own
ontology
similarly
a
variety
of
different
approaches
have
been
proposed
for
robot
exploration
and
mapping
of
unknown
environments
we
cast
these
diverse
representations
into
a
natural
structure
that
we
call
the
spatial
semantic
hierarchy
ssh
in
which
the
objects
relations
and
assumptions
at
each
level
are
abstracted
from
the
levels
below
each
level
of
the
ssh
has
its
own
mathematical
foundation
the
control
level
allows
the
robot
and
its
environment
to
be
formalized
as
a
continuous
dynamical
system
whose
stable
equilibrium
points
can
be
abstracted
to
a
discrete
set
of
quot
distinctive
states
quot
trajectories
linking
these
states
can
be
abstracted
to
actions
giving
a
discrete
causal
graph
representation
of
the
state
space
the
causal
graph
of
states
and
actions
can
in
turn
be
abstracted
to
a
topological
network
of
places
and
paths
local
metrical
models
such
as
occupancy
grids
of
neighborhoods
of
places
and
paths
can
then
be
built
on
the
framework
of
the
topological
network
without
their
usual
problems
of
global
consistency
mathematical
principles
of
logic
programming
vladimir
lifschitz
logic
programming
as
well
as
its
sister
approach
functional
programming
is
based
on
the
view
that
a
computer
program
does
not
need
to
contain
any
explicit
operational
instructions
instead
it
can
simply
provide
a
set
of
facts
about
the
problem
that
is
sufficient
to
solve
it
such
a
quot
declarative
quot
program
can
be
executed
using
methods
of
automated
reasoning
prolog
is
the
best
known
logic
programming
language
the
mathematical
theory
of
logic
programming
is
concerned
with
defining
the
semantics
of
logic
programming
languages
describing
the
reasoning
algorithms
used
to
implement
them
and
investigating
the
soundness
of
these
algorithms
adaptive
libraries
and
high
level
optimization
calvin
lin
this
talk
describes
a
new
approach
to
building
software
libraries
by
making
libraries
that
can
adapt
in
both
their
implementation
and
their
interfaces
to
different
application
needs
and
different
hardware
platforms
we
can
produce
libraries
that
are
more
efficient
and
more
widely
usable
we
describe
a
new
framework
for
building
such
libraries
we
describe
three
planned
experiments
that
apply
these
techniques
to
libraries
for
parallel
scientific
computation
and
we
explain
how
our
approach
facilitates
high
level
optimizations
learning
sequential
decision
tasks
through
symbiotic
evolution
of
neural
networks
risto
miikkulainen
a
novel
reinforcement
learning
method
called
sane
symbiotic
adaptive
neuro
evolution
evolves
a
population
of
neurons
through
genetic
algorithms
to
form
a
neural
network
for
a
given
task
symbiotic
evolution
promotes
both
cooperation
and
specialization
in
the
population
which
results
in
a
fast
efficient
genetic
search
and
discourages
convergence
to
suboptimal
solutions
sane
is
able
to
extract
domain
specific
information
even
under
sparse
reinforcement
which
makes
it
an
effective
approach
to
a
broad
range
of
sequential
decision
tasks
such
as
robot
control
game
playing
and
resource
management
alamo
the
net
as
a
data
warehouse
dan
miranker
the
alamo
effort
is
directed
at
intra
net
development
and
inter
net
users
who
can
enumerate
interesting
sites
and
data
sources
the
goal
is
to
integrate
the
data
sources
and
provide
the
user
with
the
illusion
of
a
single
virtual
database
followed
by
query
analysis
and
presentation
tools
central
to
the
alamo
architecture
is
a
software
bus
called
the
abstract
search
machine
asm
the
asm
is
a
corba
compliant
interface
that
provides
a
uniform
interface
to
heterogeneous
data
sources
beyond
simple
data
access
the
asm
embodies
a
higher
level
of
abstraction
enabling
the
efficient
coding
of
clever
search
algorithms
and
separating
and
isolating
system
concerns
including
buffering
and
data
prefetch
the
broad
claim
is
that
high
performance
often
optimal
implementations
of
advanced
database
facilities
such
as
an
object
oriented
query
engine
a
deductive
inference
engine
an
active
database
engine
and
data
mining
facilities
can
all
be
constructed
using
the
asm
as
a
common
interface
finally
since
the
output
of
each
of
these
advanced
database
facilities
can
themselves
serve
as
data
sources
the
components
of
the
alamo
architecture
can
be
composed
to
resolve
higher
level
data
integration
problems
in
particular
we
anticipate
using
the
elements
of
alamo
itself
to
represent
meta
data
and
resolve
both
structural
and
semantic
conflicts
among
the
data
sources
ultimately
further
compositions
will
embody
complex
knowledge
bases
and
be
able
to
answer
high
level
queries

ilp
addresses
the
problem
of
learning
prolog
programs
from
examples
the
representational
power
of
first
order
logic
offers
advantages
over
standard
machine
learning
methods
constrained
to
use
fixed
length
feature
vectors
we
are
applying
ilp
methods
to
natural
language
learning
where
we
believe
this
richer
representation
offers
important
advantages
we
have
developed
an
ilp
system
chill
for
learning
deterministic
parsers
from
a
corpus
of
parsed
sentences
chill
obtains
superior
results
on
several
artificial
corpora
previously
used
to
test
neural
network
methods
and
encouraging
results
on
the
more
realistic
atis
corpus
of
airline
queries
chill
has
also
been
used
to
the
automatically
develop
a
complete
natural
language
interface
that
translates
english
database
queries
into
executable
prolog
form
producing
a
more
accurate
parser
than
a
hand
built
system
for
querying
a
small
geographic
database
we
have
also
developed
an
ilp
system
foidl
which
has
been
applied
to
learning
the
past
tense
of
english
surpassing
the
previous
results
of
neural
network
and
decision
tree
methods
on
this
problem
software
reuse
by
specialization
of

gordon

software
reuse
is
clearly
a
good
idea
but
it
is
difficult
to
achieve
in
practice
if
your
data
does
not
fit
the
assumptions
of
the
software
reusing

in
our
approach

how
application
data

a
compilation
process
can
specialize
a
generic

to
produce
a

that
is

analysis
of

greg

a
major
focus
of
theoretical
computer
science
is
the
design
and
analysis
of
asymptotically
efficient
algorithms
sequential
parallel
distributed
deterministic
randomized
for
specific
computational
problems
in
this
research
area
it
is
not
uncommon
to
come
across
well
written
papers
in
which
informally
i
the
main
underlying
ideas
are
conceptually
straightforward
ii
the
formal
presentation
is
surprisingly
lengthy
and
iii
most
of
the
formalism
deals
with
minor
side
issues
and
special
cases
that
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
main
underlying
ideas
in
such
papers
there
seems
to
be
a
significant
gap
between
the
conceptual
and
formal
difficulty
of
the
algorithm
being
presented
are
such
gaps
inherent
or
is
conventional
mathematical
notation
simply
inadequate
for
succinctly
formalizing
certain
conceptually
straightforward
algorithmic
ideas
in
this
talk
i
will
describe
a
notation
for
asymptotic
analysis
called
o_i
notation
that
significantly
reduces
the
quot
conceptual
to
formal
gap
quot
associated
with
a
non
trivial
class
of

as
a
concrete
example
i
consider

the

vijaya

the
design
and
analysis
of
efficient
parallel
algorithms
for
combinatorial
problems
has
been
an
area
of
extensive
study
in
recent
years
and
a
large
number
of
algorithms
have
been
developed
on
the
abstract
pram
model
of
parallel
computation
in
this
talk
we
will
describe
some
of
our
work
in
the
design
of
efficient
parallel
algorithms
and
our
experience
with
implementing
and
evaluating
these
algorithms
on
a
massively
parallel
machine
maspar

we
will
then
describe
a
quot
queuing
quot
variant
of
the
pram
model
which
we
propose
as
a
more
appropriate
model
for
currently
available
parallel
shared

machines
than
traditional
pram
models
extensible
languages
open
compilers
and
reflection
paul
wilson
extensible
languages
allow
interesting
new
features
to
be
added
to
a
language
portably
from
within
the
language
itself
open
compilers
allow
fairly
easy
modification
of
compilers
to
add
new
features
analyses
and
optimizations
reflection
allows
a
program
to
examine
a
representation
of
interesting
parts
of
itself
and
affect
its
own
structure
accordingly
i
ll
discuss
these
things
why
they
re
useful
for
building
modular
portable

adapatable
software
i
ll
also
discuss

daisy
dsi
programming
system
description
dsi
is
an
system
for
symbolic
multiprocessing
based
on
the
underlying
operational
model
of
suspending
construction
the
fundamental
synchronization
mechanism
in
this
model
is
the
suspension
a
transparent
object
representing
a
computation
suspensions
evolve
into
manifest
data
values
which
can
be
inspected
and
manipulated
by
other
computations
computation
is
demand
oriented
a
relaxation
of
demand
driven
computation
in
which
a
system
with
available
processing
resources
can
speculatively
activate
suspensions
for
bounded
execution
we
are
interested
in
this
model
as
a
general
basis
for
improving
the
performance
of
limited
scale
multiprocessors
daisy
is
a
surface
language
for
programming
in
the
dsi
system
daisy
is
an
applicative
language
a
mutation
of
scheme
with
provisions
for
exploiting
a
suspending
list
constructor
among
these
provisions
are
constructs
for
building
networks
of
streams
including
windowing
operations
for
stream
based
i
o
these
facilities
make
daisy
a
good
language
for

overview
our
group
is
part
of
the
department
of
computer
sciences
at
univ
texas
at
austin
the
long
term
goal
of
our
research
is
to
develop
technology
for
constructing
and
using
large
multifunctional
knowledge
bases
on
computers
these
knowledge
bases
would
significantly
improve
current
expert
systems
and
tutoring
systems
because
they
contain
the
broad
knowledge
of
a
domain
required
to
perform
multiple
tasks
and
to
explain
domain
knowledge
from
multiple
viewpoints
during
the
past
eight
years
we
have
built
a
large
knowledge
base
in
one
area
of
biology
and
developed
methods
for
automatically
answering
a
variety
of
questions
using
the
knowledge
base
containing
about
180
000
facts
concerning
30
000
concepts
our
knowledge
base
is
one
of
the
largest
of
its
kind
i
e
its
content
is
structured
and
formally
represented
in
addition
to
expanding
this
knowledge
base
we
are
also
beginning
to
construct
similar
knowledge
bases
in
other
domains
most
notably
the
domain
of
distributed
computing
we
are
especially
encouraged
by
the
results
from
using
our
knowledge
base
for
a
variety
of
ai
tasks
most
recently
james
lester
used
the
biology
knowledge
base
to
test
his
system
for
explanation
generation
the
system
generated
about
60
explanations
expressed
in
english
concerning
biological
objects
and
events
in
a
controlled
experiment
domain
experts
found
little
difference
between
these
explanations
and
those
written
by
their
colleagues
currently
we
are
extending
the
types
of
questions
that
can
be
answered
using
automated
reasoning
with
a
large
knowledge
base
jeff
rickel
developed
a
method
for
compositional
modeling
the
task
of
constructing
a
model
appropriate
for
answering
a
prediction
what
if
question
performing
this
task
well
requires
building
the
simplest
model
that
can
adequately
answer
the
question
a
daunting
requirement
since
knowledge
bases
like
ours
implicitly
contain
many
models
at
numerous
levels
of
detail
the
qualitative
process
compiler
and
qsim
are
used
to
simulate
the
models
built
by
jeff
s
program
finally
we
are
testing
the
generality
of
our
research
results
by
building
a
knowledge
base
in
another
domain
distributed
computing
environments
focussing
on
osf
s
dce
to
construct
a
help
desk
assistant
for
automatically
answering
a
proportion
of
customer

questions
which
would
otherwise
be

students
who
have
not
taken
these
classes
or
similar
classes
taught
at
another
university
should
not
register
for
comp
202
despite
what
your
advisor
or
other
students
may
tell
you
there
may
be
some
students
who
have
not
taken
comp
122
or
comp
181
who
may
be
able
to
learn
the
material
covered
in
these
classes
on
their
own
before
the
fall
semester
begins
however
i
think
this
is
a
risky
course
of
action
for
most
people
another
note
comp
122
mentioned
in
the
previous
paragraph
is
the
quot
new
quot
comp
122
which
is
a
course
intended
for
undergraduates
before
last
year
comp
122
was
taught
as
a
senior
undergraduate
first
year
graduate
level
course
final
note
if
you
are
planning
to
take
this
course
then
i
suggest
that
you
read
the
first
13
chapters
of
the
textbook
before
the
semester
begins
i
plan
to
review
this
material
with
blazing
speed
if
you
ve
taken
the
122
prerequisite
then
reading
these
chapters
shouldn
t
pose
any
serious
problems
for
you
this
textbook
is
a
quick
read
latest
word
on
textbooks
i
m
told
that
there
are
90
copies
at
the
bookstore
with
more
on
backorder
why
they
ve
ordered
more
is
a
mystery
to
me
maybe
it
s
because
122
is
using
the
same
book
the
edition
is
the
same
as
last
year
the
1990
edition
i
had
heard
a
new
edition
is
coming
out
this
year
but
i
guess
it
isn
t
ready
yet

department
at
the
university
of
massachusetts
at
amherst
is
led
by
professors
jim
kurose
and
don
towsley
our
group
s
research
spans
a
broad
range
of
topic
areas
addressing
both
subnetwork
and
host
related
issues
and
represents
a
complementary
mix
of
both
theoretical
and
applied
experimental
research
much
of
the
group
s
work
is
motivated
by
emerging
broadband
high
speed
networks
and
their
ability
to
carry
a
diverse
mix
of
multimedia
traffic
the
groups
research
divides
broadly
into
four
areas
multicasting
parallelized
protocols
for

multiprocessors
multimedia
and

is
the
science
and
art
of
selecting
and
interconnecting
hardware
components
to
create
a
computer
that

goals
this
course
qualitatively

quantitatively
examines

tradeoffs
we
will
learn
for

how

concurrently
and
why

project
the
default
project
is
to
do
some
original
research
in
a
group
of
three
students
for
example
you
could
examine
a
modest
extension
to
a
paper
studied
in
class
or
simply
re
validate
the
data
in
some
paper
by
writing
your
own
simulator
alternatively
you
may
work
in
a
group
of
two
to
write
a
paper
that
surveys
an
area
within
computer
architecture
projects
will
include
an
oral
presentation
and

syllabus
randomization
is
a
powerful
tool
for
achieving
efficiency
and
or
simplicity
in
many
settings
this
course
will
study
a
variety
of
techniques
for
using
randomization
in
algorithm
design
randomization
typically
introduces
uncertainty
which
could
be
uncertainty
regarding
the
result
or
uncertainty
regarding
the
algorithm
s
performance
but
this
is
tolerable
if
it
is
of
sufficiently
low
probability
primality
testing
and
quicksort
respectively
provide
examples
of
each
of
these
techniques
for
analyzing
the
probabilistic
correctness
and
performance
of
randomized
algorithms
will
be
a
central
part
of
the
course
prerequisites
honors
analysis
of
algorithms
or
a
in
fundamental
algorithms
or
equivalent
background
with
permission
of
the
instructor
the
course
also
assumes
familiarity
with
basic
probability
and
counting
such
as
might
be
encoutered
in
an
analysis
of
quicksort
or
of
an
idealized
hashing
scheme
assignments
there
will
be
homeworks
comprising
problems
drawn
from
the
textbook
and
elsewhere
late
homeworks
will
not
be
accepted
except
in
the
event
of
illness
of
other
unavoidable
circumstances
if
for
some
reason
you
will
be
unable
to
hand
in

women
in
computer

some
female
faculty
graduate
students
and
undergraduates
have
formed
a
group
called
wics
women
in
computer
science
one
of
the
group
s
goals
is
to
encourage
more
women
to
become
computer
science
majors
so
if
there
are
any
women
in
this
class
who
would
like
to
talk
to
someone
about
majoring
in
computer
science
or
doing
graduate
studies
in
computer
science
or
if
there
are
any
women
who
would
like
some
extra
help
with
their
classwork
they
should
see
suzan

the
c
language
cs
367
will
be
taught
using
the
c
programming
language
and
you
will
be
required
to
do
your
programming
assignments
in
c
we
didn
t
choose
c
just
to
make
your
life
more
difficult
most
people
who
become
fluent
in
c
think
it
is
far
superior
to
c
or
pascal
the
use
of
c
is
growing
tremendously
in
the
field
and
the
odds
are
that
if
you
ever
have
to
write
another
program
after
this
course
ends
you
will
be
able
to
write
it
in
c
the
same
statement
is
not
true
about
pascal
c
is
also
widely
available
but
after
an
initial
startup
period
you
will
be
more
productive
in
c
than
in
c
if
you
go
on
to
take
more
computer
science
courses
with
few
exceptions
you
will
be
required
to
use
c
in
those
courses

this
is
a
well
written
text
that
covers
most
but
not
all
of
the
material
in
this
course
it
also
includes
a
lot
about
c
so
a
separate
text
for
the

is
not
necessary
for

lecture
notes
fall
1993
by
david
j
dewitt
these
notes
are
actually
considerably
more
complete
that
simple
lecture
notes
but
they
are
still
short
of
a
true
text
book
there
is
very
little
narrative
text
no
exercises
etc
as
a
recommended
additional
source
you
may
want
to
purchase
these
notes
which
are
available
from
the
doit
documentation
desk
near
the
dayton
street
entrance
of
the
computer
sciences
building
1210
w
dayton
st
if
this
is
the
first
experience
with
unix
for
you
you
will
need
some
information
about
activating
your
account
logging
in
creating
editing
and
manipulating
files
and
compiling
running
and
debugging
programs
the
handout
cs
1000
available
from
the
doit
information
desk
where
the
dewitt
notes
are
available
contains
all
the
key
information
you
will
find
it
invaluable
see
also
the
help
section
below
as
i
mentioned
above
the
lectures
will
often
follow
the
dewitt
notes
although
i
may
supplement
them
with
a
few
handouts
during
the
course
of
the
semester
nonetheless
you
are
responsible
for
all
material
covered
in
lecture
the
exams
will
be
based
on
the
lecture
material
reading
assignments
in
the
notes
and
the
course
assignments
grading
there
will
be
one
or
two
evening
exams
during
the
course
of
the
semester
a
final
exam
and
five
programming
assignments
the
exams
will
determine
50
of
the
final
grade
with
approximately
equal
weight
for
each
one
and

assignments
must
be
done
in
c
on
the
designated
machines
these
are
in
the
machine
rooms
on
the
first
floor
of
the
cs
building
i
encourage
you
to
use
these
machines
if
you
prefer
to
use
a
home
computer
you
may
do
so
with
certain
restrictions
you
must
have
a
c
compiler
on
your
home
machine
you
must
log
on
to
your
university
account
often
to
read
email
and
get
copies
of
data
files
finally
we
will
require
that
you
turn
in
your
c
program
electronically
via
email
so
if
you
work
at
home
you
must
make
provisions
to
download
your
programs
to
your
university
account
and
to
make
sure
that
they
compile
and
run
with
the
g
compiler
on
the
sparcstations
i
often
use
electronic
mail
to
notify
students
of
changes
in
assignments
hints
for
programs
etc
i
assume
that
you
will
read
all
electronic
mail
that
i
send
late
policy
no
late
assignment
will
be
accepted
assignments
must
be
turned
in
exactly
when
they
are
due
in
order
to
avoid
lateness
caused
by
machine
loads
coincident
due
dates
for
several
classes
etc
simply
be
sure
to
get
started
right
away
on
each
assignment
things
are
certain
to
go
wrong
now
and
then
so
don
t
wait
until
the
last
minute
to
start
any
exceptions
must
be
approved
by
me
and
you
will
need
a
very
good
excuse
if
you
get
into
trouble
see
me
as
soon
as
possible
cheating
the
computer
science
department
takes
a
very
hard
line
stance
on
cheating
you
are
welcome
to
communicate
with
each
other
on
design
of
algorithms
and
data
structures
but
there
is
to
be
no
sharing
of
code
you
are
also
expected
to
learn
understand
and
obey
the
computer

lab
policies
governing
your

help
if
you
are

please
let

help
debugging
a
program
the
best
way
to
get
help
is
to
visit
any
one
of
the
cs
367
ta
s
during
his
office
hours
taking
along
a
current
hard
copy
of
your
program
my
office
hours
are
intended
as
a
time
for
me
to
re
explain
concepts
that
i
have
presented
in
class
but
about
which
you
are
still
confused
or
to
answer
your
specific
questions
about
course
material
i
encourage
you
to
use
email
as
a
reliable
way
to
contact
me
about
any
problems
i
read
and
respond
to
email
several
times
daily
almost
every
day
of
the

program
grading
programs
are
graded
on
all
of
the
following
criteria
correctness
the
program
should
behave
correctly
normally
on
typical
input
the
program
should
behave
as
stated
in
the
project
specifications
clarity
the
program
should
be
easy
to
read
and
understand
see
the
notes
on
style
below
for
more
information
about
clarity
robustness
correct
behavior
in
extreme
or
unusual
situations
the
program
should
handle
such
situations
in
a
reasonable
and
logical
manner
that
is
it
should
not
simply
blow
up
quality
of
test
data
the
test
data
for
the
program
should
demonstrate
all
facets
of
the
program
s
capabilities
including
unusual
cases
efficiency
avoid
unnecessarily
inefficient
algorithms
or
constructs
however
efficiency
should
never
be
pursued
at
the
expense
of
clarity
modularity
the
program
should
be
modular
and
should
make
effective
use
of
parameters
completeness
you
should
incorporate
all
information
into
your
program
there
should
be
no
need
for
any
sort
of
extra
paper
documentation
generality
the
program
should
be
as
general
as
possible
subject
to
consideration
of
efficiency
and
clarity
you
should
avoid
arbitrary
limitations
such
as
a
bound
on
the
size
or
complexity
of
the
input
whenever
possible
when
limitations
are
necessary
they
should
be
expressed
as
defined
constants
near
the
top
of
the
program
so
that
they
can
be
easily
changed
the
only
numeric
literals
that
should
appear
in
your
program
are
those
values
not
very
likely
to
change
such
as
0

this

at

it
is
addressed
to
both
the
typical
user
and
to
someone
who
wants
to
know
superficially
how
the
program
works
include
your
full
name
and
student
id
at
the
beginning
of
the
comment
give
a
general
description
of
what
the
program
does

format

made
describe

if
you
don

we
will

you
were

description
need
not
be
repeated
but
may
be
briefly
summarized
for
the

sufficient
note
that
this
only

description
internal
documentation
there
are
four
main
types
of
internal
documentation
headers
comments
at
the
headers
of
functions
classes
and
major
data
structures
should
describe
their
purpose
assumptions
about
their
parameters
and
the
main
outline
of
any
algorithms
they
use
declarations
comments
next
to
a
declaration
of
a
variable
or
data
member
should
provide
extra
information
not
conveyed
by
the
identifier
s
name
the
name
of
a
variable
should
tell
as
much
about
it
as
is
possible
without
making
it
too
long
additional
information
can
be
supplied
by
a
comment
for
example
int
top
index
of
last
element
added
to
stack
you
should
use
comments
to
explain
parameters
as
well
as
local
variables
within
segments
of
code
tricky
or
opaque
sections
of
code
should
be
avoided
but
sometimes
they
are
necessary
in
such
cases
a
comment
can
help
the
reader
understand
what
s
going
on
between
segments
of
code
these
comments
clarify
the
top

of
your
algorithm
using
unix

many
people
working
with
unix
for
the
first
time
will
find
that
it
takes
some
time
to
become
comfortable
with
it
this
is
particularly
true
if
your
only
previous
programming
experience
is
with
pascal
using
macpascal
on
a
macintosh
i
strongly
urge
you
to
put
in
the
time
early
in
the
semester
to
become
comfortable
with
unix
while
this
time
may
be
painful
it
is
time
well
spent
also
you
may

to

enormous
effort
is
currently
expended
in
creating
scientific
software
particularly
for
simulating
physical
systems

is
to
reduce
this
effort
by
bringing
together
technologies
such
as
geometric
modeling
symbolic
mathematics
numerical
analysis
compilation
code
generation
and
formal
methods
to

letter

letter
spirit
an
emergent
model
of
the
perception
and
creation
of
alphabetic
style
description
the
letter
spirit
project
is
an
attempt
to
model
central
aspects
of
human
high
level
perception
and
creativity
on
a
computer
it
is
based
on
the
belief
that
creativity
is
an
automatic
outcome
of
the
existence
of
sufficiently
flexible
and
context
sensitive
concepts
what
we
call
fluid
concepts
accordingly
our
goal
is
to
implement
a
model
of
fluid
concepts
in
a
challenging
domain
not
surprisingly
the
letter
spirit
project
is
a
very
complex
undertaking
and
requires
complex
dynamic
memory
structures
as
well
as
a
sophisticated
control
structure
based
on
the
principles
of
emergent
computation
wherein
complex
high
level
behavior
emerges
as
a
statistical
consequence
of
many
small
computational
actions
the
full
realization
of
such
a
model
will
we
believe
shed
light
on
the
mechanisms
of
human
creativity
the
specific
focus
of
letter
spirit
is
the
creative
act
of
artistic
letter
design
the
aim
is
to
model
how
the
26
lowercase
letters
of
the
roman
alphabet
can
be
rendered
in
many
different
but
internally
coherent
styles
the
program
addresses
two
important
aspects
of
letterforms
the
categorical
sameness
possessed
by
letters
belonging
to
a
given
category
e
g
a
and
the
stylistic
sameness
possessed
by
letters
belonging
to
a
given
style
e
g
helvetica
starting
with
one
or
more
seed
letters
representing
the
beginnings
of
a
style
the
program
will
attempt
to
create
the
rest
of
the
alphabet
in
such
a
way
that
all
26
letters
share
that
same

parallel

have
become
the
premiere
computational
engines
for
both
business
and
research
endeavors
and
their
use
is
permeating
into
many
other
disciplines
in
addition
new
ways
of
interacting
with
computers
have
evolved
enabling
higher
levels
of
interaction
among
end
users
as
well
as
enhanced
interactivity
between
end
users
and
their
programs
than
previously
possible
as
a

of
these
developments

all
of
which
are
interconnected
via
high

while
such

and
some
of
the

readily

what
is
lacking
is
the
technology
for
easily
assembling
them
to
form

that
are
efficient

for

the
development
of
such

is
a
fundamental
challenge
for
systems
researchers
the
systems

in
the
college

addresses
this

in
