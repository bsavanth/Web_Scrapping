library
2000
jerome
h
saltzer
professor
of
computer
science
and
engineering
library
2000
is
a
research
project
that
is
exploring
the
system
engineering
of
future
on
line
libraries
the
project
s
approach
is
pragmatic
to
develop
build
and
prime
with
data
a
prototype
testbed
of
an
on
line
electronic
library
using
the
technology
and
system
configurations
expected
to
be
economically
feasible
in
the
year
2000
the
initial
data
is
the
accumulated
collection
of
m
i
t
computer
science
technical
reports
in
the
form
of
scanned
images
our
basic
hypothesis
is
that
the
technology
of
on
line
storage
display
and
communications
will
soon
make
it
economically
possible
to
place
the
entire
contents
of
any
library
on
line
and
make
them
accessible
from
computer
workstations
located
anywhere
our
vision
is
that
one
will
be
able
to
browse
any
book
journal
paper
thesis
or
report
using
an
ordinary
personal
computer
and
follow
citations
by
pointing
the
report
or
paper
selected
should
pop
up
immediately
in
an
adjacent
window
our
goal
is
not
to
invent
or
develop
any
of
these
evolving
technologies
but
rather
to
work
out
how
to
harness
them
the
engineering
and
deployment
of
large
scale
systems
is
always
accompanied
by
traps
and
surprises
beyond
those
apparent
in
the
component
technologies
typical
research
topics
include
discovering
wanted
items
robustly
linking
to
information
across
the
network
and
making
on
line
information
endure
reliably
for
decades
