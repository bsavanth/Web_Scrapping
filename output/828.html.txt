require
a
long
explanation
are
best
answered
by
myself
please
see
me
during
office
hours
or
send
me
e
mail
i
am
not
normally
in
my
office
except
during
office
hours
because
i
do
my
research
from
home
via
a
modem
therefore
if
you
want
to
see
me
outside
of
office
hours
please
make
an
appointment
first
you
can
most
easily

problem
solving
exercises
one
of
the
most
important
skills
you
will
learn
in
this
class
is
problem
solving
good
problem
solving
skills
distinguish
a
good
computer
programmer
from
a
bad
one
it
doesn
t
matter
how
familiar
or
skilled
you
are
in
a
particular
programming
language
if
you
do
not
understand
how
to
solve
the
problem
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
write
a
computer
program
for
it
in
any
language
to
help
you
learn
problem
solving
skills
and
techniques
i
will
assign
weekly
problem
solving
exercises
these
will
be
small
but
non
trivial
problems
which
i
will
give
out
each
monday
you
should
look
at
the
problem
and
think
about
it
during
the
week
and
right
down
the
steps
you
would
go
through
to
solve
the
problem
i
e
the
overall
structure
of
your
program
this
is
primarily
an
exercise
in
general
problem
solving
so
you
do
not
have
to
write
any
fortran
code
though
you
may
if
you
want
to
and
have
time
and
your
solution
algorithm
should
not
even
be
dependent
on
a
particular
programming
language
such
as
fortran
we
will
go
over
the
solution
in
class
the
following
monday
exercises
computer
lab
you
will
be
using
the
vectra
lab
in
rm
1350
computer
science
statistics
containing
hewlett
packard
vectra

running
microsoft
windows
and
microsoft

this
lab
is

am
seven
days
a
week
except
certain
holidays
the
printer
room
is
located
across
the
hall
in
rm
1359
you
have
a
quota
of
300
pages
on
which
to
print
once
you
exceed
that
quota
you
must
contact
the
lab
either
by
e
mail
or
by
going
to
room
2310
during
office
hours
they
prefer
e
mail
to
pay
to
increase
your
quota
beware
some
of
the
machines
in
the
vectra

aren
t
configured
correctly
in
particular
the
machines
along
the
wall
closest
to
the
outside
hallway
towards
the
left
hand
part
of
the
room
try
to
avoid
those
if
you
can
you
may
also
use
your
home
or
dorm
computers
to
write
your
programs
however
you
will
probably
have
to
purchase
your
own
copy
of
microsoft
fortran
or
lahey
personal
fortran
see
the
inside
cover
of
the
textbook
you
may
also
work
in
any
of
the
other
computer
labs
on
campus
however
most
do
not
have
fortran
compilers
please
see
me
first
