periodic

periodic
and
cyclic
motion
analysis
steve

many
real
life
motions
are
periodic
in
some
frame
of
reference
for
instance
most
human
locomotory
motions
e
g
walking
running
skipping
shuffling
are
periodic
in
a
frame
of
reference
that
moves
with
the
person
we
have
developed
an
approach
for
determining
if
an
image
sequence
could
have
been
produced
by
an
object
whose
motion
is
periodic
in
some
reference
frame
unlike
all
previous
attempts
to
determine
periodicity
information
our
approach
allows
the
camera
to
move
during
filming

sequence
of

turntable
ramps

to

in

where
the
turntable
was
momentarily

the

the

from
which
it
was
recovered
real
repeating

tend
not
to
be
perfectly
even

e
the
period
varies
slightly
from
one
cycle
to
the
next
because
of
physically
important
changes
in
the
scene
a
generalization
of
period
is
defined
for
cyclic
motions
that
makes
periodic
variation
explicit
this
representation
called
the
period
trace
is
compact
and
purely
temporal
describing
the
evolution
of
an
object
or
scene
without
reference
to
spatial
quantities
such
as
position
or
velocity
by
delimiting
cycles
and
identifying
correspondences
across
cycles
the
period
trace
provides
a
means
of
temporally
parsing
a
cyclic
motion
in
addition
several
purely
temporal
motion
features
can
be
derived
relating
to
the
nature
and
location
of
irregularities
the
period
trace
can
also
be
used
for
medical
image
enhancement
by
compositing
images
from
different
cycles
furthermore
the
period
trace
can
be
reliably
recovered
from
image
sequences
in
a
view
invariant
fashion
using
a
theory
of
affine
invariance
