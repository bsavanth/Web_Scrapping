the
hypercomputing
and
design
project
the
hypercomputing
and
design
project
the
web
pages
for
hpcd
are
under
construction
overview
the
broad
objective
of
hpcd
is
to
build
on
top
of
advances
in
massively
parallel
computing
hypercomputing
in
computational
science
in
ai
and
in
modeling
simulation
technology
and
to
develop
a
new
generation
of
engineering
automation
technology
that
can
bring
about
dramatic
gains
in
productivity
of
the
national
industrial
base
the
top
level
goal
is
to
develop
hypercomputing
methods
for
attaining
order
of
magnitude
speedups
in
the
time
required
for
transition
from
an
innovative
design
concept
or
and
a
scientific
advance
to
a
useful
high
quality
product
the
focus
of
the
effort
is
on
design
of
complex
engineering
systems
such
as
computers
ships
jet
engines
where
the
design
process
is
strongly
dependent
upon
the
use
of
knowledge
from
several
scientific
disciplines
the
main
technical
goals
of
the
project
are
as
follows
to
develop
methods
that
use
hypercomputing
power
in
conjunction
with
scientific
knowledge
in
a
domain
ai
and
visiometric
techniques
in
order
to
build
computational
models
and
related
simulations
in
the
domain
that
range
from
the
highly
accurate
but
costly
models
needed
for
scientific
discovery
and
design
verification
to
the
greatly
reduced
and
approximate
but
cheap
models
needed
to
explore
large
spaces
of
design
alternatives
to
develop
methods
and
tools
based
on
ai
and
other
related
areas
of
computer
and
computational
science
to
help
in
the
setup
and
control
of
complex
simulations
and
the
automatic
analysis
and
interpretation
of
massive
datasets
produced
from
simulation
runs
to
develop
methods
and
tools
that
use
computational
models
efficiently
to
manage
control
the
formulation
and
solution
of
complex
design
problems
hpcd
is
an
arpa
ito
sponsored
project
within
the
framework
of
the
national
hpcc
program
the
project
is
intended
as
a
major
step
towards
building
a
comprehensive
national
resource
for
hpc
based
computational
methods
and
facilities
that
can
address
the
grand
challenge
of
design
the
project
is
organized
as
a
large
scale
multidisciplinary
multi
institutional
consortium
involving
researchers
from
academia
and
industry
participating
universities
include

the
component
efforts
of
hpcd
are
designed
to
address
the
three
main
technical
goals
of
the
project
by
proceeding
bottom
up
via
exploration
of
selected
concrete
design
problems
and
by
developing
methodologies
and
tools
in
a
manner
which
is
strongly
influenced
by
the
pull
of
these
problems
to
achieve
cohesion
in
the
overall
res
arch
effort
the
component
efforts
are
organized
in
two
main
clusters
cluster
i
concentrating
on
design
and
manufacturing
of
computers
and
of
related
microstructures
and
cluster
ii
concentrating
on
design
tasks
that
are
critically
dependent
on
computational
fluid
dynamics
cfd
there
is
also
a
third
supporting
cluster
of
core
work
cluster
iii
whose
emphasis
is
on
computer
computational
science
foundations
and
methodologies
that
are
related
to
work
in
the
two
main
clusters
each
cluster
includes
efforts
in
two
or
three
research
areas
collaboration
among
researchers
and
synergy
among
component
efforts
are
an
integral
part
of
the
approach
