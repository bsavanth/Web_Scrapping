learning
intelligent
learning
environments
summary
the
cognition
and
technology
group
at
vanderbilt
ctgv
is
developing
the
jasper
woodbury
problem
solving
series
a
videodisc
based
program
designed
to
motivate
students
and
help
them
learn
to
think
and
reason
mathematically
about
complex
realistic
problems
as
part
of
this
project
we
are
developing
a
collection
of
computer
based
learning
environments
that
incorporate
the
project
s
constructivist
theories
generative
learning
techniques
and
anchoring
macrocontexts
into
an
intelligent
learning
environment
design
the
resulting
paradigm
macrocontexts
plus
microworlds
mpms
where
microworld
exploration
and
problem
solving
is
anchored
within
an
interesting
macrocontext
two
systems
we
have
constructed
and
tested
are
adventureplayer
a
trip
planning
microworld
that
can
be
anchored
to
a
jasper
macrocontext
this
system
allows
students
to
construct
evaluate
and
reason
about
solutions
to
trip
planning
problems
and
smarttools
also
linked
to
a
trip
planning
microworld
where
students
study
and
develop
graphical
tools
to
quickly
answer
various
questions
about
distance
time
rate
and
gas
consumption
this
system
has
also
been
used
as
a
test
bed
for
studying
the
richness
of
computer
traces
for
protocol
analysis
both
systems
incorporate
beneficial
aspects
of
both
intelligent
tutoring
systems
and
cognitive
tools
through
reflective
interaction
scaffolding
and
coaching
current
work
in
this
area
is
focusing
on
an
onr
sponsored
project
for
studying
student
understanding
of
ac
circuit
concepts
the
goal
is
to
develop
appropriate
instructional
methodologies
and
computer
based
environments
for
training
technicians
in
complex
maintenance
and
troubleshooting
tasks
