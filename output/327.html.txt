seminar
the
purpose
of
this
page
is
to
provide
some
web
links
relevant
to
the
seminar
on
quantum
computing
in
the
directory
cs
classes
cis607theory
papers
you
can
find
downloaded
copies
of
some
relevant
papers
admittedly
this
is
of
no
help
for
those
of
you
on
machines
outside
the
cis
department
if
you
have
downloaded
a
potentially
interesting
paper
feel
free
to
move
or
copy
it
to
that
directory
and
amend
the
readme
file
appropriately
this
can
help
avoid
saving
multiple
copies
of
these
files
the

just
to

there
is
also
a

american
article
which
itself
is
short

has
some
interesting

which

faq
charlie
wright
mentions
concerning
a
tutorial
available
from
a
site
in
israel
the
tutorial
looks
eminently
readable
to
me
and
not
as
frighteningly
technical
as
it
might
at
first
appear
ignore
the
stuff
about
doping
it
takes
forever
to
download
it
from
israel
but
it
s
quite
fast
to
get
from

you
come

other

that
should
be
