logic
and
computation
formerly
the
institute
for
advanced
concepts
in
programming
language
theory
the
focus
of
this
research
group
is
on
logic
in
computer
science
with
particular
interest
in
lambda
calculus
and
functional
programming
types
constructive
mathematics
proof
theory
linear
logic
and
semantics
our
group
is
equipped
with
the
usual
array
of
workstations
backed
up
by
a
complex
of
turbocharged
multitape
turing
machines
a
prototype
high
speed
optimal
reduction
machine
and
a
type
directed
partial
evaluator
as
of
september
1996
we
are
running
a
weekly
seminar
on
logic
and
programming
language
theory
tentatively
devoted
to
topics
in
linear
logic
and
extracting
computational
content
from
classical
proofs
