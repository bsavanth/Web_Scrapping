description
the
goals
of
the
memoria
project
are
to
use
source
level
analysis
to
improve
the
memory
performance
of
advanced
microprocessors
current
research
efforts
include
algorithms
for
combining
software
prefetching
and
unroll

automatic
optimization
of
linear
algebra
codes
optimizing
loop
order
for
cache
performance
and
using
high

this
project
is
intimately
