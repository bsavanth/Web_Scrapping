overview
traditional
multicast
routing
mechanisms
e
g
dvmrp
and
mospf
were
intended
for
use
within
regions
where
groups
are
widely
represented
or
bandwidth
is
universally
plentiful
when
group
members
and
senders
to
those
group
members
are
distributed
sparsely
across
a
wide
area
these
schemes
are
not
efficient
data
packets
or
membership
report
information
are
periodically
sent
over
many
links
that
do
not
lead
to
receivers
or
senders
respectively
this
characteristic
lead
the
internet
community
to
investigate
multicast
routing
architectures
that
efficiently
establish
distribution
trees
across
wide
area
internets
where
many
groups
are
sparsely
represented
and
where
bandwidth
is
not
uniformly
plentiful
due
to
the
distances
and
multiple
administrations
traversed
efficiency
is
evaluated
in
terms
of
the
state
control
message
processing
and
data
packet
processing
required
across
the
entire
network
in
order
to
deliver
data
packets
to
the
members
of
the
group
the
protocol
independent
multicast
sparse
mode
pim
sm
architecture
maintains
the
traditional
ip
multicast
service
model
of
receiver
initiated
membership
uses
explicit
joins
that
propagate
hop
by
hop
from
members
directly
connected
routers
toward
the
distribution
tree
builds
a
shared
multicast
distribution
tree
centered
at
a
rendezvous
point
and
then
builds
source
specific
trees
for
those
sources
whose
data
traffic
warrants
it
is
not
dependent
on
a
specific
unicast
routing
protocol
and
uses
soft
state
mechanisms
to
adapt
to
underlying
network
conditions
and
group
dynamics
the
robustness
flexibility
and
scaling
properties
of
this
architecture
make
it
well
suited
to
large
heterogeneous
inter
networks
