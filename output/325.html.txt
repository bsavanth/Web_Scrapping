algorithms
and
computational
theory
group
the
algorithms
and
computational
theory
group
focuses
on
the
theoretical
foundations
of
computer
science
the
current
research
interests
of
faculty
in
the
group
include
algorithm
design
complexity
theory
parallel
computation
graph
theory
and
probabilistic
methods
a
major
focus
of
the
group
is
on
the
design
and
analysis
of
provably
efficient
algorithms
for
solving
fundamental
computational
problems
where
efficiency
can
be
measured
in
terms
of
different
resources
such
as
time
space
number
of
processors
and
number
of
random
bits

warm
warm
stands
for
the
workshop
on
algorithms
research
in
the
midsouth
or
midsouthwest
this
is
a
forum
for
researchers
in
theoretical
computer
science
in
texas
and
surrounding
states
that
meets
once
or
twice
a
year
at
different
locations
each
meeting
consists
of
several
talks
by
researchers
in
the
region
on
their
recent
research
results
often
there
is
a
distinguished
keynote
speaker
the
first
warm
was
organized
by
vijaya
ramachandran
at
ut
austin
in
the
spring
of
1990
greg
plaxton
organized
another
warm
at
ut
austin
in
fall
1994
warm
has
been
held
at
several
other

the
next

is
scheduled
to
be
held
at

1996
program
announcements
about
warm
are

when
they
become

also
we
usually
try
to

to
attend
warm

announcements
regarding
these

are
also
