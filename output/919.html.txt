the
principal
incentive
for

aside

to

no

some
problem
sets
will
be
collected
and
selected
problems
will
be
read
and
commented
upon
since
no
grades
are
assigned
you
are
free
to
work
together
however
it
is
important
at
exam
time
that
you
be
able
to
write
up
solutions
in
your
own
words
one
approach
might
be
to
meet
with
other
students
to
discuss
and
perhaps
solve
problems
then
reconstruct
the
solution
later
