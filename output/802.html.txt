java
java
is
an
curious
mixture
of
extreme
hype
and
sound
technology
this
fall
cs838
is
a
graduate
seminar
that
will
examine
java
including
the
java
programming
language
network
security
design
of
distributed
applets
java
virtual
machines
and
java
implementations
compilers
interpreters
and
special
hardware
other
java
related
topics
are
both
welcome
and
encouraged
this
course
will
be
taugh
as
a
research
seminar
first
the
professors
are
not
java
experts
but
expect
to
learning
along
with
the
students
what
you
get
out
of
this
course
will
be
experience
in
studying
and
developing
new
ideas
interactioning
with
colleagues
and
new
insight
into
java
we
only
plan
to
lecture
for
a
few
weeks
to
present
an
overview
of
java
then
students
will
work
on
two
month
long
group
projects
students
will
be
evaluated
on
the
oral
and
written
presentation
of
their
project
this
offering
of
cs
838
is
not
a
core
cs
course
background
material
there
is
no
text
for
this
course
although
there
are
countless
java
books
in
bookstores
most
of
these
books
were
written
very
quickly
and
are
very
superficial
the
addison
wesley
series
is
the
quot
official
quot
sun
reference
books
on
java
and
are
much
better
than
the
average
but
see
below
many
of
them
are

for

assignment
below
is
a
list
of
possible
project
topics
it
is
intended
as
a
starting
point
not
an
enumeration
a
comparison
of
java
with
c
smalltalk
scheme
and
simula
an
implementation
of
a
java
interpreter
that
caches
recently
used
basic
blocks
on
the

compilation
of
java
applets
on
small
memory
embedded
machines
the
memory
system
behavior
of
compiled
vs
interpreted
java
applets
an
evaluation
of
alternative
implementations
of
java
monitors
a
comparison
of
the
java
virtual
machine
with
xerox
mesa
bytecodes
the
microarchitecture
of
a
processor
that
directly
executes
java
bytecodes
optimizing
java
compiler
rationalizing
the
java
library
performance
evaluation
tools
and
results
for
java
programs
evaluation
of
java
security
investigate
compiling
other
languages
to
the
java
vm
subset
of
c
gt
java
vm
would
be
very
interesting
investigate
was
of
formalizing
the
security
requirements
of
a
language
and
system
and
ways
of
automatically
generating
verifying
vm
implementations
any
security
related
topic
investigate
the
cost
of
making
the
primitive
types
int
float
bool
etc
objects
and
eliminating
the
dual
type
systems
in
particular
is
java
s
static
typing
sufficient
to
alleviate
the
overheads
java
eel
dynamic
compilation
can
the
language
mandated
tests
array
bounds
null
pointer
etc
be
scheduled
in
unused
cycles
on
superscalar
processors
so
that
java
runs
as
fast
as
an
unsafe
language
