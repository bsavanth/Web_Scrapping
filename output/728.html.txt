this

is
under
construction
project
overview
microprocessors
and
memories
are
made
on
distinct
manufacturing
lines
yielding
10
m
transistor
microprocessors
and
256
m
transistor
drams
one
of
the
biggest
performance
challenge
today
is
the
speed
mismatch
between
the
microprocessors
and
memory
to
address
this
challenge
we
predict
that
over
the
next
decade
processors
and
memory
will
be
merged
onto
a
single
chip
not
only
will
this
narrow
or
altogether
remove
the
processor
memory
performance
gap
it
will
have
the
following
additional
benefits
provide
an
ideal
building
block
for
parallel
processing
amortize
the
costs
of
fabrication
lines
and
better
utilize
the
phenomenal
number
of
transistors
that
can
be
placed
on
a
single
chip
let
s
dub
it
an
iram
standing
for
intelligent
ram
since
most
of
transistors
on
this
merged
chip
will
be
devoted
to
memory
whereas
current
microprocessors
rely
on
hundreds
of
wires
to
connect
to
external
memory
chips
irams
will
need
no
more
than
computer
network
connections
and
a
power
plug
all
input
output
devices
will
be
linked
to
them
via
networks
as
will
be
other
irams
if
they
need
more
memory
they
get
more
processing
power
as
well
and
vice
versa
an
arrangement
that
will
keep
the
memory
capacity
and
processor
speed
in
balance
a
single
gigabit
iram
should
have
an
internal
memory
bandwidth
of
nearly
1000
gigabits
per
second
32
k
bits
in
50
ns
a
hundredfold
increase
over
the
fastest
computers
today
off
chip
accesses
will
go
over
1
gigabit
per
second
serial
links
hence
the
fastest
programs
will
keep
most
memory
accesses
within
a
single
iram
rewarding
compact
representations
of
code
and
data
history
the
initial
efforts
of
the
iram
project
were
undertaken
during
the
spring
1996
offerring
of

at
uc
berkeley
this
advanced
graduate
course
led
by
prof
david
patterson
re
examined
the
design
of
hardware
and
software
that
is
based
on
the
traditional
separation
of
the
memory
and
the
processor
the
course
web
page
contains
a
considerable
amount
of
useful
information
including
copies
of
slides
from
many
guest
speakers
as
well
as
the
results
from
three
sets
of
projects
performed
by
more
than
a
dozen
graduate
students
an
earlier
discussion
that
helped
lead
to
the
development
of
this
course

iram
s
large
improvement
in
memory
system
bandwidth
has
significant
potential
for
helpng
configurable
systems
to
achieve
their
full
performance
potential
configurable
systems
offer
improved
performance
by
adapting
processing
capabilities
to
application
specific
needs
but
by
making
the
processing
portion
of
an
application
go
faster
a
conventional
memory
system
will
be
more
and
more
of
a
drag
on
performance
memory
bandwidth
is
also
the
performance
bottleneck
to
rapid
reprogramming
of
the
configurable
elements
for
these
reasons
the

group
is
working
