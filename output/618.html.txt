the
trains
project
natural
spoken
dialogue
and
interactive
planning
the
trains
project
at
the
university
of
rochester
department
of
computer
science
is
a
long
term
effort
to
develop
an
intelligent
planning
assistant
that
is
conversationally
proficient
in
natural
language
the
goal
is
a
fully
integrated
system
involving
online
spoken
and
typed
natural
language
together
with
graphical
displays
and
gui
based
interaction
the
primary
application
has
been
a
planning
and
scheduling
domain
involving
a
railroad
freight
system
where
the
human
manager
and
the
system
must
cooperate
to
develop
and
execute
plans
research
in
the
trains
project
has
been
along
two
tracks
first
the
project
has
supported
ph
d
thesis
research
in
natural
language
processing
speech
interpretation
discourse
processing
planning
and
reasoning
under
uncertainty
complete
references
are
available
from
the
resources
given
below
second
over
the
course
of
the
project
we
have
periodically
pulled
the
research
threads
together
and
produced
limited
but
working
demonstration
systems
based
on
the
theories
the
hope
is
that
this
incremental
development
is
converging
towards
the
ultimate
goal
of
a
fully
conversant
system
details
of
these
systems
are
also
available
from
many
of
the
references
given
below
and
in
particular
in
the
jetai
paper
current
research
in
the
trains
project
centers
on
an
interactive
route
planning
assistant
dubbed
trains

details
are
available
in
a

at
the
arpa
spoken
language
technology
workshop
and
in
a
paper
to
appear
in
aips
96
work
in
progress
involves
a
more
realistic
domain
and
more
complicated
planning
problems
we
still
hope
to
have
a
version
of
the
trains
system
running
over
the
