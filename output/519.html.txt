computational
complexity
various
papers
on
recent
results
will
supplement
the
text
rough
course
outline
the
actual
list
of
topics
may
vary
slightly
from
the
list
that
follows
below
depending
on
the
interests
of
the
class
for
instance
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
include
more
material
about
the
relationship
between
finite
model
theory
and
complexity
theory
if
there
is
sufficient
interest
this
course
covers
the
field
of
computational
complexity
theory
beginning
with
the
fundamental
theorems
that
delimit
what
one
can
expect
of
such
a
theory
we
will
also
study
the
diagonalization
techniques
that
continue
to
be
among
the
most
powerful
tools
in
complexity
theory

theorem
the
notions
that
have
the
most
practical
importance
in
classifying
the
complexity
of
problems
are
complexity
classes
and
reducibility
among
problems
many
important
complexity
classes
are
characterized
most
simply
in
terms
of
variants
of
nondeterministic
