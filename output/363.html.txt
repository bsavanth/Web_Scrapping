topics
the
purpose
of
the
course
is
to
understand
the
nature
of
computation
by
investigating
several
different
models
formal
languages
including
regular
languages
context
173
free
languages
recursive
languages
and
languages
which
can
be
recognized
in
polynomial
time
and
other
tools
will
be
used
to
study
the
comparative
power
of
these
models
there
will
not
be
enough
time
to
cover
the
entire
book
but
we
will
include
some
sections
from
almost
every
chapter
the

chapters
are

work
mostly
problem
sets
will
be
assigned

be
accepted
except
for
illness
or

reasons
normally
40
of
