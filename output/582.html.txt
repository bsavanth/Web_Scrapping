overview
the
ability
to
acquire
view
animate
and
analyze
3
d
objects
in
a
computer
is
becoming
increasingly
important
when
we
see
3
d
objects
in
a
computer
we
need
to
ask
the
question
how
did
they
get
in
there
there
are
many
different
methods
and
approaches
to
answering
this
question
the
methods
differ
depending
on
size
how
do
you
acquire
and
model
a
molecular
structure
an
anatomical
part
of
the
body
a
person
a
machine
a
building
and
upon
function
of
the
model
model
s
that
need
to
be
viewed
only
do
not
have
to
be
geometrically
or
topologically
correct
models
that
are
used
for
physical
analysis
or
simulation
may
need
to
be
this
course
will
explore
3
d
modeling
in
detail
and
from
a
variety
of
viewpoints
robotics
medicine
graphics
virtual
reality
etc
we
will
discuss
3

devices
3
d

systems
3
d
file
formats
and
algorithms
to
acquire
create
augment
manipulate
render
and
physically
build
such
models
prerequisite
experience
with
at
least
1
of
the
following
topics
computer
graphics
computer
vision
or
computer
aided
design
in
addition
there
will
be
programming
in
c
and
c
so
students
need
a
proficiency
in
at
least
one
of
these
languages
any
student
who
is
unsure
of
his
her
background
should
contact

text
papers
and

to
be
provided
in

a
small

will
be
involved
course
format
there
will
be
a
weekly
class
with
lectures
by
professor
allen
and
assigned
papers
to
be
presented
by
class
members
the
grade
will
be
based
upon
each
student
s
paper
presentation
and
a
group
project
project
one
potential
project
will
be
to
actually
acquire
a
3
d
object
using
sensors
and
from
this
create
a
model
that
can
be
manipulated
by
the
computer
as
well
as
physically
building
the
3
d
model
on
the
rapid
prototyping
machine
in
our
lab
another
project
may
be
recovering
a
3
d
model
of
a
building
on
campus
using
photography
other
projects
of
the
student
s
choosing
are
also
possible

may
be
individual
