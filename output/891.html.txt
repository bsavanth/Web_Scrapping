visual
design

analog
computers
description
analog
field
computers
have
a
strongly
visual
component
in
their
design
whether
the
analogy
is
concrete
such
as
to
a
butterfly
wing
or
abstract
such
as
to
a
matrix
of
quaternions
the
ability
to
design
a
field
computer
depends
on
the
ability
to
visualize
the
system
our
research
involves
defining
the
transformations
used
to
map
a
system
to
an
analog
computer
and
formalizing
the
inference
methods
used
in
visual
design
