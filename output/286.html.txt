conceptual
models
of
computing
a
introduction
could
a
computer
be
conscious
what
would
a
continuous
programming
language
be
like
what
kind
of
materiality
exists
on
the
web
how
will
computation
affect
the
future
of
science
what
about
quantum
and
dna
computers
is
it
ethical
to
give
computers
power
over
human
life
addressing
such
questions
requires
knowing
what
computers
are
and
what
computation
is
to
a
depth
it
is
argued
in
this
course
beyond
that
reached
by
current
theories
come
and
find
out
why
what
we
know
what
we
don
t
know
what
a
more
adequate
theory
would
look
like
a
critical
examination
of
the
conceptual
foundations
of
computing
focusing
on
the
models
and
metaphors
in
terms
of
which
we
understand
computing
from
programs
to
processes
architecture
to
abstraction
parameterization
to
parallelism
and
the
use
of
computational
concepts
in
adjacent
fields
from
cognitive
science
to
physics
economics
to
art
initially
we
focus
on
six
traditional
views
formal
symbol
manipulation
recursive
function
theory
effective
computability
computational
complexity
digital
state
machines
information
processing
and
newell
and
simon
s
notion
of
a
physical
symbol
system
non
standard
views
are
also
considered
such
as
connectionism
non
linear
dynamics
and
artificial
life
throughout
each
view
is
judged
by
its
ability
to
do
justice
to
practice
we
conclude
by
briefly
considering
the
wider
role
of
computational
concepts
in
intellectual
life
including
their
affect
on
our
self
conception
