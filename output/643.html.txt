horus
effort
has
developed
a
programming
environment
for
reliable
distributed
computing
during
the
last
year
horus
was
used
to
demonstrate
groupware
and
fault
tolerance
over
high
performance
networks
and
was
found
to
offer
higher
performance
than
other
similar
systems
novel
features
of
horus
are
its
flexible
software
architecture
in
which
applications
pay
only
for
features
that
they
use
and
support
for
virtually
synchronous
process
groups
a
technology
that
we
developed
in
our
prior
work
on
the
isis
toolkit
which
has
become
a
significant
commercial
success
horus
also
offers
a
fault
tolerant
security
and
privacy
technology
which
we
view
as
an
important
research
advance
during
1995
we
will
be
extending
horus
to
provide
extremely
low
latency
high
performance
real
time
capabilities
our
approach
combines
elements
of
a
communication
technology
called
active
messages
with
a
multi
media
playback
system
called
continuous
media
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
expect
to
demonstrate
high
speed
interactive
applications
with
remote
multimedia
servers
such
as
might
be
used
in
remote
telemedicine
applications
or
video
on
demand
systems
all
of
this
will
retain
the
existing
fault
tolerance
and
security
options
of
horus
and
its
virtual
synchrony
programming
model
prior
work
on
isis
has
created
a
substantial
user
base
and
we
expect
rapid
uptake
of
horus
within
this
community
as
it
matures
isis
users
span
a
wide
range
of
industries
including
telecommunications
systems
financial
trading
systems
stock
market
automation
factory
floor
process
control
for
discrete
electronic
component
manufacture
air
traffic
control
and
space
based
communications
system
management
and
control
applications
of
isis
are
being
explored
in
several
branches
of
the
military
as
well
as
the
nsa
and
other
non
military
government
branches
among
the
more
visible
military
efforts
is
the
naval
hiper
d
project
which
is
exploring
the
use
of
isis
in
a
new
system
that
prototypes
technologies
for
future
enhancements
of
the
aegis
battle
radar
system
the
more
demanding
applications
in
this
user
base
would
benefit
from
access
to
horus
and
our
initial
plan
is
to
make
it
possible
to
migrate
isis
applications
to
horus
with
few
changes
thus
benefiting
this
community
in
a
direct
way
technology
transition
has
occured
through
licensing
agreements
with
isis
distributed
systems
inc
a
subsidiary
of
stratus
computers
however
all
of
our
cornell
work
is
also
available
to
researchers
at
no
fee
and
is
described
through
detailed
publications
and
programming
manuals
looking
to
the
future
we
hope
that
a
mixture
of
isis
and
horus
technologies
will
permit
us
to
develop
some
of
the
very
demanding
applications
that
will
be
seen
in
next
generation
groupware
and
planning
systems
the
illustration
below
shows
such
an
application
a
military
mission
control
and
planning
system
that
integrates
data
from
a
variety
of
space
air
and
ground
resources
and
uses
this
to
coordinate
actions
of
various
theatre
assets
systems
of
this
sort
will
demand
the
utmost
in
performance
reliability
and
security
while
also
tolerating
failures
and
rapidly
reconfiguring
to
respond
to
changing
demands
success
in
our
project
will
thus
impact
a
wide
range
of
both
civilian
and
military
technology
