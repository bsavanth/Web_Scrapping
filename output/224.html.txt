overview
cashmere
stands
for
coherence
algorithms
for
shared
memory
architectures
and
is
an
ongoing
effort
to
provide
efficient
scalable
shared
memory
with
minimal
hardware
support
it
is
well
accepted
today
that
commercial
workstations
offer
the
best
price
performance
ratio
and
that
shared
memory
provides
the
most
desirable
programming
paradigm
for
parallel
computing
unfortunately
shared
memory
emulations
on
networks
of
workstations
provide
acceptable
performance
for
only
a
limited
class
of
applications
cashmere
attempts
to
bridge
the
performance
gap
between
shared
memory
emulations
on
networks
of
workstations
and
tightly
coupled
cache
coherent
multiprocessors
while
using
minimal
hardware
support
in
the
context
of
cashmere
we
have
discovered
that
ncc
numa
non
cache
coherent
non
uniform
memory
access
machines
can
greatly
improve
the
performance
of
dsm
systems
and
approach
that
of
fully
hardware
coherent
multiprocessors
the
basic
property
of
ncc
numa
systems
is
the
ability
to
access
remote
memory
directly
such
a
capability
is
offered
by
a
variety
of
network
interfaces
including
dec
s
memory
channel
hp
s
hamlyn
and
the
princeton
shrimp
given
current
technology
the
additional
hardware
cost
of
ncc
numa
systems
over
pure
message
passing
systems
is
minimal
based
on
this
fact
and
our
performance
results
we
believe
that
ncc
numa
machines
lie
near
the
knee
of
the
price
performance
curve
the
department
of
computer
science
at
the
university
of
rochester
is
building
a
32
processor
cashmere
prototype
significant
part
of
the
funding
comes
in
the
form
of
an
equipment
grant
from
digital
equipment
corporation
the
prototype
consists
of
eight
4
processor
dec
2100
4
233
multiprocessors
on
a
memory
channel
network
the
memory
channel
plugs
into
any
pci
bus
it
provides
a
memory
mapped
network
interface
with
which
processors
can
read
and
write
remote
locations
without
kernel
intervention
or
inter
processor
interrupts
end
to
end
bandwidth
is
currently
about
40
mb
sec
remote
write
latency
is
about
3
5
us
the
next
hardware
generation
is
expected
to
increase
bandwidth
by
approximately
one
order
of
magnitude
and
cut
latency
by
half
cashmere
augments
the
functionality
of
the
memory
channel
by
providing
cache
coherence
in
software
implementation

cashmere
