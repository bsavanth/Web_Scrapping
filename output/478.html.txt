project

and
computation

of
1922

solving
scientific
problems
increasingly
depends
on
high
speed
computation
careful
planning
of
numerically
based
experiments
and
high
level
qualitative
interpretation
of
large
volumes
of
quantitative
data
working
jointly
with
the
artificial
intelligence
ai
laboratory
researchers
within
mit
s
project
on
mathematics
and
computation
are
developing
a
wide
range
of
intelligent
computation
tools
to
help
scientists
and
engineers
understand
mathematical
models
of
physical
processes
some
of
the
project
s
goals
include
efficient
new
algorithms
specialized
hardware
and
smart
programs
that
comprehend
measured
or
numerical
data
much
of
our
work
in
scientific
computation
is
based
on
ai
methods
we
have
used
computer
vision
techniques
for
example
to
create
programs
that
look
at
and
qualitatively
interpret
graphical
results
of
numerical
experiments
other
programs
can
construct
numerical
simulation
systems
of
dynamically
complex
processes
such
as
oscillating
chemical
reactions
and
nonlinear
vibrating
beams
then
automatically
incorporate
them
into
qualitative
analysis
programs
such
programs
can
also
generate
high
level
summary
descriptions
graphically
and
in
english
of
numerical
experiments
similar
to
the
descriptions
that
appear
in
published
scientific
and
engineering
papers
to
support
the
automatic
construction
of
numerical
procedures
we
are
seeking
ways
to
express
numerical
algorithms
in
terms
of
high
order
procedural
abstractions
sophisticated
numerical
routines
thus
can
be
assembled
by
mixing
and
matching
components
from
a
numerical
library
the
large
library
of
routines
we
are
now
assembling
will
contain
symbolic
methods
as
well
as
numeric
ones
our
work
rests
on
the
scheme
dialect
of
lisp
and
the
scheme
programming
environment
which
we
invented
and
continue
to
develop
we
have
joined
with
other
scheme
users
and
developers
to
formally
standardize
this
dialect
through
the
ieee
we
expect
that
our
freely
available
native
code
scheme
compiler
will
offer
performance
comparable
to
that
of
the
best
commercial
lisp
compilers
