many
designers
say
design
for
the
people
who
will
use
your
designs
and
know
your
users
the
cognitive
sciences
have
developed
a
base
of
knowledge
about
people
in
general
and
a
good
deal
of
it
is
actually
useful
in
interface
design
also
the
common
suggestion
well
go
study
some
people
can
be
performed
better
with
more
trustworthy
results
if
you
have
knowledge
of
testing
techniques
this
course
introduces
a
practical
side
of
the
cognitive
sciences
oriented
to
designers
focused
readings
and
homework
assignments
will
cover
useful
highlights
of
the
theory
and
high

methodologies
students
will
see
cases
of
when
and
how
different
areas
of
cognitive
theory
may
and
may
not
be
useful
to
design
additionally
students
will
learn
about
and
try
different

for

a
background
in
cognition
and
perception
is
not
expected
course
topics
are
likely
to
have
little
overlap
with
those
in
psychology
classes
and
the
perspective
will
be
different
where
there
is
overlap
the
course
will
be
oriented
around
weekly
readings
and
regular
homework
assignments
which
exercise
skills
that
support
design
and
analysis
the
midterm
is
likely
to
be
a
take
home
on
the
scale
of
a
big
homework
there
will
probably
not
be
a
final
exam
