to
get
put
on
the
list
reading
material
pearl
probabilistic
reasoning
in
intelligent
systems
this
is
the
required
text
for
the
class
and
we
will
read
several
chapters
you
can
probably
get
by
without
buying
it
if
you
re
strapped
for
cash
though
it
s
a
nice
reference
book
shafer
and
pearl
readings
in
uncertain
reasoning
this
is
a
nice
collection
of
foundational
papers
on
reasoning
and
uncertainty
and
we
will
read
several
selections
a
copy
will
be
available
in
the
grail
library
e
t
jaynes
probability
theory
the
logic
of
science
fragmentary
edition
of
july
1995
this
is
an
extremely
interesting
technical
and
historical
look
at
the
foundations
of
probability
theory
statistics
and
decision
theory
definitely
worth
looking
at
for
the
reference
list
and
historical
perspective
alone
the
math
can
be
heavy
going
in
places
but
it
s
beautifully
written
neapolitan
probabilistic
reasoning
in
expert
systems
theory
and
algorithms
a
significant
overlap
with
the
pearl
book
so
a
good
secondary
source
for
information
about
graphical
models
and
propagation
algorithms
this
is
available
from
the
math
research
library
other
papers
to
be
arranged
course
summary
here
is

the
