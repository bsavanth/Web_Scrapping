gaggle
theory
description
gaggle
and
not
giggle
is
the
pronunciation
of
the
acronym
ggl
for
generalized
galois
logic
this
is
an
algebraic
abstraction
that
covers
most
of
existing
natural
logics
classical
modal
intuitionistic
relevant
linear
bck
lambek
calculus
etc
a
gaggle
is
a
great
generalization
of
the
ideas
of
jonnson
and
tarski
s
boolean
algebras
with
operators
operators
can
distribute
or
co
distribute
in
various
of
their
places
over
either
meet
or
join
and
are
also
required
to
interact
with
each
other
in
a
way
that
generalizes
the
notions
of
galois
connection
and
residuation
the
idea
is
to
give
a
representation
theorem
using
kripke
frames
and
to
interpret
an
n
ary
operator
using
a
n
1
placed
accessibility
relation
as
for
example
necessity
in
modal
logic
is
interpreted
using
a
binary
accessibility
relation
while
the
original
focus
was
gaggles
based
on
underlying
distributive
lattices
the
project
has
been
extended
to
underlying
partial
orders
semi
lattices
involuted
semi
lattices
and
lattices
