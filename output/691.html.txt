description
the
course
provides
an
introduction
to
the
theory
of
computation
the
treatment
is
mathematical
but
the
point
of
view
is
that
of
computer
science
roughly
speaking
the
theory
of
computation
consists
of
three
overlapping
subareas
1
formal
languages
and
automata
2
computability
and
recursive
function
theory
3
complexity
theory
the
course
will
focus
mostly
on
1
and
2
applications
of
1
to
programming
and
natural
language
specification
and
recognition
in
particular
compiler
construction
will
be
emphasized
topics
will
include
basics
of
language
