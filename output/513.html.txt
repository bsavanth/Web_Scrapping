adms
are
some
of
the
unique
features
in
this
system
the
adms
enhanced
client
server
database
architecture
dynamically
distributes
data
and
processing
to
possibly
mobile
clients
which
can
then
be
deployed
at
a
remote
site
adms
provides
transparent
access
to
multiple
and
heterogeneous
database
systems
including
oracle
ingres
and
sybase
the
innovations
of
this
architecture
are
a
the
utilization
of
mobile
clients
having
full
database
management
capability
for
downloading
caching
and
accessing
database
subsets
whether
connected
to
or
disconnected
from
their
heterogeneous
servers
and
b
the
use
of
incremental
access
methods
for
asynchronous
refresh
of
downloaded
data
on
the
mobile
clients
