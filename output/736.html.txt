is
a
unique
infrastructure
for
distributed
robotics
remote
operations
and
distributed
simulation
research
using
a
object
oriented
protocol
and

this
distributed
laboratory
consists
of

the
distributed

configuration
provides
the
opportunity
to
quantitatively
study
the
effects
of
various
system
components
and
technologies
on
overall
telerobotic
task
performance
we
have
successfully
implemented
and
demonstrated
first
in
feb
1991
the
ability
to
execute
representative
inspection
and
manipulation
tasks
with
multiple

robot
and

simultaneously
connected
operations
are
carried
out
on
a
routine
basis
during
the
process
needs
for
hardware
and
software
standards
development
have
been
identified
the
current
implementation
provides
the
basis
to
link
government

and
university
facilities
to
realize
a
truly
collaborative
