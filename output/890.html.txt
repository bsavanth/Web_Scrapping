there
has
been
considerable
interest
recently
in
employing
simple
observer
behaviors
that
either
make
the
recovery
of
scene
properties
easier
e
g
fixation
or
combine
simple
behaviors
in
order
to
perform
complex
tasks
such
as
navigation
and
obstacle
avoidance
our
work
focuses
on
the
ability
of
an
active
observer
to
control
the
point
of
observation
to
perform
tasks
involving
the
exploration
of
an
object
the
developed
behaviors
that
are
provably
correct
make
simple
motion
decisions
that
are
based
on
the
observed
local
geometry
of
the
scene
and
require
minimal
processing
of
each
image
we
first
consider
the
task
of
recovering
the
local
shape
of
the
surface
at
a
selected
point
our
approach
is
based
on
the
general
observation
that
some
positions
provide
more
information
about
an
object
than
others
the
existence
of
such
special
viewpoints
can
be
exploited
only
if
the
observer
is
mobile
and
has
an
efficient
and
deterministic
strategy
for
reaching
them
we
show
that
the
local
shape
recovery
task
can
be
achieved
using
a
simple
and
qualitative
strategy
for
smoothly
controlling
the
point
of
observation
until
the
viewing
direction
is
aligned
with
a
principal
direction
at
the
selected
point
second
we
consider
the
task
of
deriving
a
global
description
of
an
object
we
formulate
global
surface
reconstruction
as
the
qualitative
task
of
smoothly
controlling
the
point
of
observation
so
that
the
visible
rim
slides
over
a
maximal
connected
reconstructible
region
we
show
that
this
task
can
be
provably
achieved
for
arbitrary
smooth
surfaces
by
attempting
to
maintain
a
well
defined
geometric
relationship
between
the
point
of
observation
and
the
viewed
surface
our
approach
suggests
that
the
ability
to
smoothly
control
the
point
of
observation
can
lead
to
provably
correct
behaviors
for
achieving
both
local
and
global
tasks
e
g
scene
exploration

d
navigation
while
also
simplifying
per
frame
computations
