purpose
the
goal
of
the
computer
visualization
laboratory
cvl
is
to
investigate
methodologies
for
integrating
computing
and
visual
communication
to
explore
technologies
that
make
feasible
the
fusion
between
the
two
and
to
provide
state
of
the
art

capabilties
for
use
in
research
and
instruction
the
laboratory
acquires
promotes
and
disseminates
video
