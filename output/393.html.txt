content
the
seminar
will
be
a
research
oriented
investigation
of
selected
topics
in
the
area
of
distributed
computing
to
illustrate
some
of
the
fundamental
and
most
interesting
aspects
of
recent
research
i
have
chosen
some
problems
and
results
that
are
self
contained
and
have
a
puzzle
like
quality
wait
free
objects
under
certain
conditions
data
structure
operations
can
be
concurrent
and
guarantee
that
no
single
operation
is
ever
blocked
self
stabilization
how
to
write
programs
that
always
correct
themselves
after
external
disruptions
firing
squad
a
number
of
simply
stated
synchronization
problems
have
elegant
solutions
register
constructions
is
it
possible
to
create
atomicity
or
related
notions
from
components
that
themselves
are
not
atomic
interval
routing
for
certain
types
of
networks
routing
tables
can
be
quite
compact
using
graph
theoretic
properties
sorting
networks
actually
not
a
network
in
the
sense
of
the
internet
these
special
purpose
structures
show
how
parallel
sorting
counting
and
load
balancing
can
be
implemented
garbage
collection
in
a
system
with
distributed
objects
when
and
how
are
orphans
reclaimed
workload
students
are
expected
to
work
on
some
projects
and
give
presentations
since
this
is
a
research
seminar
creativity
will
be
emphasized
textbook
there
will
be
no
textbook
for
the
course
we
will
look
at
papers
from
the
literature
prerequisites
the
student
should
have
taken
22
c
194
distributed
systems
or
have
some
equivalent
exposure
to
basic
problems
of
asynchronous
distributed
computing
if
in
doubt
