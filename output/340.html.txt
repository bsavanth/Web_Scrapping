the
automated
theorem
proving
group
is
part
of
the
computer
science
and
mathematics
departments
at
the
university
of
texas
at
austin
we
produce
methods
and
systems
intended
to
prove
theorems
in
first
and
higher
order
logic
with
the
intention
of
applying
these
systems
and
methods
to
problems
primarily
in
mathematics
but
also
in
computer
science
and
technology
