documents
mission
statement
the
main
responsibilities
of
this
subgroup
are
to
provide
mechanisms
for
providing
access
and
managing
licenses
to
use
intellectual
property
in
the
digital
library
and
to
design
and
implement
facilities
for
economic
allocation
of
resources
including
documents
in
the
collections
information
services
and
computation
processing
storage
and
transport
in
designing
these
mechanisms
we
seek
to
maximize
the
value
accruing
to
both
providers
and
consumers
participating
in
the
umdl
our
approach
will
be
to
provide
an
environment
whereby
the
participants
engage
in
transactions
they
deem
mutually
beneficial
this
will
include
a
general
framework
for
negotiation
of
terms
and
delivery
of
information
services
as
well
as
a
suite
of
specific
protocols
implementing
some
standard
forms
of
agreement
we
will
evaluate
alternate
mechanisms
according
to
allocation
efficiency
equity
and
computational
and
other
transaction
costs
