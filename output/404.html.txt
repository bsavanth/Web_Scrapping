the

book
is
an
informal
text
book
for
the
course
maintained
by
volunteers
this
is
a
compressed
version
of
the
postscript
file
feel
free
to
download
it
and
print
it
in
the
science
center
however
we
recommend
that
you
purchase
a
printed
and
bound
copy
from
the
sourcebook
center
in
the
basement
of
the
science
center
i
tried
printing
this
once
and
it
took
hours
plus
i
had
to
hole
punch
the
hardcopy
myself
that
ate
up
an
afternoon
my
book
was
also
twice
as
bulky
because
i
did
not
want
to
fiddle
with
printing
double
sided
make
life
easy
buy
the
book
lisp
links
we
will
try
to
place
interesting
lisp
related
materials
in
this
section
clisp
for
linux
this
is
a
user
friendly
common
lisp
implementation
that
many
of
the
tfs
prefer
on
their
own
systems
for
special
instructions
on
how
to
install
this
if
you
are
using
elf
binaries
consult
this
lisp
faq
online
common
lisp
manual
you
can
search

for
descriptions
of

and
