large
scale
parallel
software
group
william
e
weihl
associate
professor
of
computer
science
and
engineering
researchers
in
the
large
scale
parallel
software
group
develop
new
and
easier
methods
of
writing
efficient
parallel
programs
some
of
the
projects
in
the
group
are
conducted
jointly
with
the
parallel
and
distributed
operating
systems
group
current
research
is
conducted
in
three
major
areas
first
work
that
was
begun
on
the
prelude
system
is
continuing
in
the
autopilot
project
with
compiler
modifications
for
c
and
other
widely
used
languages
the
goal
of
this
work
is
to
develop
compiler
and
runtime
system
mechanisms
that
raise
the
level
of
abstraction
of
parallel
programs
thus
making
it
easier
to
port
or
tune
a
program
secondly
we
are
studying
architectural
and
operating
system
support
for
low
overhead
communication
in
multi
programmed
multi
user
systems
our
goal
is
to
combine
the
speed
of
today
s
high
performance
multiprocessors
with
the
protection
guarantees
of
distributed
systems
thirdly
we
are
developing
new
techniques
for
high
performance
simulation
of
multiprocessor
systems
work
now
under
way
focuses
on
a
parallel
implementation
of
proteus
our
single
processor
simulator
finally
group
members
are
involved
in
several
projects
dedicated
to
designing
and
evaluating
parallel
algorithms
and
applications
