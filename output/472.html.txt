galileo
is
a
project
being
conducted
in
the
computer
architecture
group
at
the
university
of
wisconsin
madison
our
project
focuses
on
the
medium
to
long
term
evolution
of
processor
and
system
architectures
with
an
emphasis
on
the
memory
system
specifically
we
are
studying
what
the
relationship
between
the
processor
and
main
memory
will
be
in
future
systems
completely
separate
as
today
or
integrated
and
if
so
to
what
extent
processing
capability
and
bit
storage
may
merge
in
at
least
two
ways
because
of
increasing
off
chip
penalties
in
issuable
instructions
and
or
limited
off
chip
bandwidth
designers
may
place
more
and
more
capacity
on
the
processor
chip
and
module
until
eventually
a
sizable
fraction
of
main
memory
resides
on
chip
represented
by
the
arrow
labeled
mop
in
the
above
diagram
a
different
possibility
is
the
migration
of
processor
capability
onto
the
dram
chips
themselves
eventually
obviating
the
central
processor
see
the
iram
arrow
above
our
specific
research
currently
focuses
on
the
following
areas
examining
the
performance
impact
of
large

latencies
and

specifically
studying
the

we
are
using
sci
which
is
an
ieee
standard
1596
1992
as
a
base
platform
for
the
exploration
of
our
ideas
the
sci
standard
specifies

protocol
which
includes
support
for
efficient
synchronization
primitives
queue

bit
or
qolb
as
well
as
optimizations
for
different
sharing
patterns
such
as
pairwise

and

sharing
the
standard
also
includes
a
definition
for
an
extremely
high

transport
layer
in
