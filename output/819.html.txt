systems
research
group
is
headed
by
prof
aloysius
mok
in
the
past
few
years
we
have
worked
towards
laying
the
groundwork
for
establishing
a
firm
theoretical
foundation
for
real
time
systems
and
also
to
build
design
tools
based
on
this
foundation
our
work
can
be
categorized
into
three
areas
as
follows
specification
and
modeling
precise
formulation
of
real
time
properties
of
systems
analysis
and
verification
reasoning
about
real
time
properties
synthesis
