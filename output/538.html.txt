mirage
is
a
distributed
shared
memory
dsm
system
which
provides
memory
management
and
communication
across
machines
in
a
loosely
coupled
network
environment
the
system
hides
network
boundaries
to
processes
accessing
shared
memory
providing
the
illusion
of
a
coarse
grained
multiprocessor
to
the
programmer
and
algorithm
designer
mirage
is
designed
to
execute
traditional
system
v
posix
compliant
shared
memory
programs
on
commodity
personal
computers
a
key
feature
in
mirage
is
the
simplicity
with
which
powerful
networking
can
be
employed
using
solutions
that
have
been
designed
for
uniprocessors
and
applied
to
a
more
powerful
network
of
workstations
platform
mirage
implements
dsm
using
a
paged
segmentation
scheme
where
segments
are
partitioned
into
pages
the
system
runs
on
a
cluster
of
ibm
ps
2
class
machines
our
lastest
work
in
the
dsm
area
is
a
non
kernel
invasive
dsm
system
based
on
the
quarks
prototype
from
utah
we
are
focusing
on
disconnected
operation
and
mobility
for
distributed
memory
shared
systems
the
new
research
is
based
on
advances
and
experiences
with
mirage
we
have
also
constructed
the
riverside
mobile
dsm
suite
which
are
a
set
of
application
programs
that
exercise
functionality
in
mobile
systems
that
one
would
expect
to
want
to
implement
using
dsm
in
addition
our
group
also
authored
the
dsm
port
of
quarks
to
the
dec
alpha
axp
150
personal
computers
and
made
the
results
of
the
port
accessible
to
other
researchers
