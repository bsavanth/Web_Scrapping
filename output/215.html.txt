we
have
devised
a
provably
correct
automated
technique
for
creating
new
views
of
a
scene
from
two
basis
views
of
the
same
scene
the
technique
relies
on
geometric
image
interpolation
known
as
morphing
in
the
graphics
community
to
produce
intermediate
images
although
morphing
techniques
currently
enjoy
widespread
use
their
theoretical
validity
has
not
been
established
in
particular
does
2
d
interpolation
of
two
views
of
the
same
scene
produce
a
sequence
of
physically
valid
in
between
views
of
that
scene
surprisingly
the
answer
is
yes
providing
the
images
first
undergo
a
simple
rectification
procedure
and
certain
assumptions
about
visibility
and
the
projection
process
are
satisfied
the
view
synthesis
work
described
here
uses
automated
stereo
techniques
to
determine
image
correspondences
our
more
recent
work
on
view
morphing
considers
how
user
interaction
may
be
used
to
guide
the
interpolation
below
are
computed
interpolations
for
three
different
image
pairs
