the
goal
of
the
brass
research
group
headed
by
john
wawrzynek
is
to
expand
the
set
of
applications
for
which
reconfigurable
computing
is
the
best
solution
we
are
working
towards
this
goal
by
improving
both
reconfigurable
architectures
and
the
compilers
for
them
specifically
we
are
investigating
the
integration
of
processors
and
reconfigurable
logic
we
are
currently
developing
the
garp
chip
which
combines
a
mips
ii
processor
with
a
fine
grained
fpga
coprocessor
on
the
same
die
see
current
projects
we
plan
to
investigate
other
architectures
as
well
this
area
is
being
actively
investigated
by
many
groups
around
the
world
here
is
a
summary
of
past
and
present
efforts
we
are
working
in
cooperation
with
the
iram
intelligent
dram
research
group
in
our
department
the
iram
group
s
co
principle
investigators
are
tom
anderson
dave
patterson
and
kathy
yelick
having
dram
on
the
same
die
will
help
supply
the
increased
memory
bandwidth
demanded
by
both
the
increased
processing
power
and
the
dynamic
loading
of
configurations
the
brass
and
iram
groups
will
hold
their
next
joint
retreat
