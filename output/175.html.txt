a
major
educational
problem
in
united
states
and
some
other
countries
is
that
students
in
grades
k
12
lose
interest
in
mathematics
and
science
as
they
progress
through
school
students
often
complain
that
mathematics
is
difficult
and
that
they
don
t
see
much
use
for
it
past
simple
arithmetic
in
response
to
these
concerns
the
national
council
of
teachers
of
mathematics
has
identified
a
number
of
features
that
the
grades
5
8
curriculum
should
include
in
order
to
help
motivate
students
to
stay
interested
favor
conceptual
learning
over
rote
operations
emphasize
practical
uses
of
mathematics
encourage
discussions
and
group
learning
and
encourage
exploratory
open
ended
learning
the
goal
of
the
metip
project
is
to
use
digital
image
processing
to
help
meet
these
objectives
in
particular
we
have
developed
a
series
of
applications
designed
to
allow
students
to
manipulate
digitized
images
of
their
choice
these
materials
are
intended
to
be
used
in
enrichment
activities
rather
than
part
of
a
standard
classroom
curriculum
teachers
can
play
various
roles
with
these
activities
for
example
they
can
catalyze
student
learning
by
leading
discussions
of
the
concepts
students
have
explored
on
the
computer
the
metip
project
currently
has
a
number
of
programs
that
allow
students
to
explore
mathematics
with
image
processing

these
applications
were
developed
primarily
for

running
microsoft

the

is
also
available
for
the

mathematics
teachers

participate
in

experimental
learning
materials
transcript
project
is
currently
designing
a
record
keeping
framework
which
will
facilitate
storage
of
personal
and
academic
information
on
a
hard
disk
or
floppy
which
is
owned
by
the
student
here
is
a
list
of
all
the
people
working
on
the
metip
project
a
closely
related
project
we
are
involved
with
is
the
study
of
multiplayer
educational
activities
the
metip
project
is
working
to
integrate
the
use
of
the
www
into
its
activities
some
ideas
are
described
in
prospects
for
the
direct
use
of
distributed
image
databases
in
educational
image
processing
currently
the
project
is
collecting
the
experiences
of
users
with
its
xform
image
transformation
software
if
you
have
done
something
fun
or
useful
with
the
software
please
let
us
know
we
are
putting
the
current
version
of
its
documentation
online
here
is
a
link
to
it
a
set
of
little
demonstrations
for
xform
has
been
put
together
by
graduate
students
who
took
a
seminar
during
the
winter
of
1996
the
xform
programming
environment
integrated
with
a
subset
of
common
lisp
offers
the
technical
essentials
for
a
new
approach
to
learning
and
teaching
computer
programming
the
fundamental
attraction
of
using
this
approach
is
that
students
learn
to
program
the
computer
in
the
pursuit
of
creating
neat
visual
effects
with
digital
images
portraying
people
or
things
of
interest
to
them
if
you
have
successfully
installed
the
software
and
would
like
to
discuss
teaching
programming
this
way
please

some
