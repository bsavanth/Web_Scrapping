you
may
use
the

class
for
the

as
long
as
it
results
in
a

procedure
as
without

if
you
do

insert

insert

results
in

code
so
just
implement
the

directly
remember
we
want
time

code
but
do
not
try

optimize

as
we
said
in
the
first
handout
you
must
work
in
the
project
and
homeworks
individually
as
i
said
before
in
the
project
my
member
functions
should
not
be
your
final
memeber
functions
the
purpose
of
the
functions
is
to
give
examples
on
how
to
acceess
the
data
however
the
data
in
the
nodes
should
be
left
untouched
in
the
project
handout
page

i
say
that
x
is
followed
by

i
should
have
said
that

in
the
project
i
say
that
when
a
arraytrienode
or
a
linkedtrienode
has
a
count
that
becomes
1
it
should
become
a
tinytrienode
that
is
incorrect
sorry
about
that
it
becomes
a
tinytrienode
when
in
addition
to
the
count
being
1
the
strends
is
true

the

you
will

you

am
as
we
say
in
the
project
description
we
are
dealing
with
sets
so
we
do
not
keep
multiple
copies
of
the
same
word
in
the
same
set
also
the
input
is
error
free
but
one
might
try
to
insert
a
word
in
a
set
that
is
already
there
or
delete
a
word
that
is
not
in
a
set
in
the
first
case
you
must
not
insert
the
word
and
the
count
needs
to
remain
unchanged
in
the
second
case
the
count
must
remain
unchanged
and
nothing
must
be
deleted
note
that
this
is
important
to
facilitate
testing
if
you
implement
insert
as
in
the
class
notes
you
will
have
to
make
to
passes
over
the
trie
in
some
cases
either
to
update
the
count
when
inserting
a
new
word
or
unupdating
the
count
if
it
was
updated
incorrectly
because
the
word
was
already
there
you
can
create
a
member
function
whoami
defined
like
getnext
to
return
the
type
of
object
you
have
for
derived
classes
like
tinytrienode
etc

remember
that
the
final
type
of
a
node
depends
on
the
number
of
words
in
that
subtree
it
does
not
depend
on
the
number
of
nodes
or
the
number
of
nonnull
pointers
in
that
subtree
