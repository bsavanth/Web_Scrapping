research
interests
the
numerical
computation
research
group
is
concerned
with
developing
analyzing
implementing
and
testing
methods
for
solving
mathematical
problems
on
computers
it
is
also
concerned
with
applications
of
numerical
methods
to
scientific
and
engineering
applications
and
with
languages
and
tools
for
numerical
computation
there
is
considerable
emphasis
on
the
development
of
methods
for
parallel
computers
specific
areas
of
emphasis
within
the
group
include
