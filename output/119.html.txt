gifford
professor
electrical
engineering
and
computer
science
the
programming
systems
research
group
is
exploring
methodologies
to
facilitate
the
discovery
and
use
of
information
our
current
projects
include
an
intelligent
query
access
system
that
implements
resource
discovery
on
the
internet
nii
digital
video
storage
composition
and
presentation
mobile
access
to
internet
resources
caching
architectures
for
information
and
personal
information
discovery
agents
these
projects
are
presently
based
on
extensions
to
semantic
file
systems
mosaic
www
servers
wais
servers
and
object
repositories
each
of
our
projects
is
designed
to
test
a
new
concept
examples
of
concepts
we
are
currently
examining
include
content
routing
algebraic
video
and
the
creative
use
highly
asymmetic
bandwidth
our
approach
to
research
is
to
use
formal
tools
implementation
and
experimentation
to
help
us
understand
the
strenghts
and
limitations
of
a
given
system
the
end
goals
of
a
project
are
to
publish
new
algorithms
and
experimental
findings
to
create
a
complete
system
that
can
be
released
for
use
by
people
outside
of
mit
and
to
have
fun
of
course
