the
intelligent
information
infrastructure
project
seeks
to
develop
an
extremely
general
system
for
distributing
and
retrieving
information
that
will
work
over
major
internet
protocols
the
early
phases
involve
building
automated
tools
for
managing
outbound
and
inbound
communications
flows
for
large
organizations
whether
via
email
distributed
hypermedia
or
other
electronic
media
after
an
initial
phase
of
developing
servers
along
these
lines
the
project
will
turn
to
interactive
tools
for
wide
area
communication
including
a
number
of
approaches
to
natural
language
understanding
the
project
grows
out
of
an
experiment
run
during
the
1992
presidential
election
when
mail
agents
distributed
campaign
information
collected
questions
from
citizens
and
allowed
volunteers
to
organize
interest
in
political
communication
continues
as
members
of
the
project
work
with
the
white
house
the
congress
and
cambridge
government
in

such
