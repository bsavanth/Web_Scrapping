the
treadmarks
distributed
shared
memory
dsm
system
the
treadmarks
distributed
shared
memory
dsm
system
treadmarks
supports
parallel
computing
on
networks
of
workstations
its
main
novel
feature
is
that
it
provides
a
global
shared
address
space
across
the
different
machines
on
a
cluster
the
shared
address
space
distinguishes
it
from
other
well
known
packages
such
as
pvm
that
provide
a
message
passing
interface
between
machines
there
is
growing
consensus
in
the
parallel
computing
community
that
a
shared
memory
interface
is
more
desirable
from
the
application
programmer
s
viewpoint
allowing
him
or
her
to
focus
on
algorithmic
development
rather
than
on
managing
communication
the
challenge
in
providing
a
shared
memory
interface
is
to
do
so
efficiently
to
this
end
treadmarks
incorporates
several
innovative
features
including
release
consistency
and
multiple
writer
protocols
current
research
going
on
in
the
treadmarks
project
includes
the
integration
of
compiler
and
runtime
techniques
the
use
of
high
level
synchronization
operators
and
the
use
of
multithreading
in
particular
on
multiprocessor
nodes
