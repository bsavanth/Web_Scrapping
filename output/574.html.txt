envy
envy
envy
is
a
design
for
a
large
solid
state
storage
system
built
primarily
with
flash
memory
its
main
goal
is
to
provide
extremely
fast
and
reliable
access
to
persistent
data
the
obvious
applications
that
can
benefit
from
such
a
system
are
databases
since
their
performance
is
usually
bound
by
the
time
it
takes
to
retrieve
and
modify
data
while
all
databases
can
obtain
significant
benefits
when
using
envy
object
oriented
databases
are
especially
well
suited
since
the
fast
access
time
of
solid
state
storage
effectively
eliminates
the
penalties
caused
by
difficulties
in
optimizing
for
sequential
disk
access
in
current
systems
in
the
envy
storage
system
data
is
stored
permanently
in
solid
state
flash
memory
as
opposed
to
traditional
systems
where
data
is
stored
on
disk
and
reads
are
sped
up
by
a
volatile
dram
cache
flash
technology
s
inherent
non
volatility
allows
envy
to
serve
as
a
permanent
data
repository
rather
than
a
volatile
cache
flash
s
simple
structure
offers
a
cost
advantage
over
all
other
forms
of
solid
state
memory
while
this
still
doesn
t
allow
flash
to
compete
with
magnetic
disks
in
terms
of
cost
per
bit
in
the
near
future
it
does
provide
a
solid
state
storage
alternative
that
can
be
used
for
performance
enhancement
when
disks
are
too
slow
envy
differs
from
other
flash
products
in
that
its
storage
is
memory
mapped
memory
mapping
allows
much
more
efficient
fine
grained
access
than
a
disk
interface
but
is
made
difficult
by
three
basic
problems
with
flash
memory
inability
to
update
in
place
relatively
large
write
latencies
and
limited
erasure
cycling
envy
overcomes
the
update
problem
by
using
page
mapping
to
implement
a
copy
on
write
scheme
with
a
small
amount
of
battery
backed
sram
to
make
updates
appear
to
be
done
in
place
even
though
they
actually
are
not
the
copy
on
write
function
also
almost
entirely
hides
the
flash
write
latency
wide
busses
provide
high
performance
and
an
efficient
cleaning
algorithm
that
includes
wear
leveling
maximizes
the
life
of
the
flash
array
in
effect
envy
provides
a
solid
state
storage
system
similar
in
both
image
and
performance
to
a
large
array
of
memory
mapped
battery
backed
sram
but
at
a
greatly
reduced
cost
our
simulations
show
that
a
typical
2
gigabyte
store
can
support
i
o
rates
corresponding
to
approximately
30
000
transactions
per
second
on
the
tpc
a
database
benchmark
average
read
and
write
latencies
for
the
simulations
were
180
ns
for
reads
and
200
ns
for
writes
