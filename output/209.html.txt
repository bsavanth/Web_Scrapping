the
course
problem
solving
is
a
pervasive
human
activity
but
some
people
are
better
at
it
than
others
part
of
this
difference
in
performance
is
due
to
differences
in
knowledge
of
effective
problem
solving
methods
because
good
problem
skills
are
particularly
important
for
computer
programing
the
art
and
craft
of
problem
solving
has
become
rather
well
developed
within
the
field
of
computer
science
the
techniques
that
have
evolved
within
computer
science
are
general
ones
that
apply
to
non
computer
problem
solving
as
well
in
this
class
we
will
examine
these
techniques
as
they
apply
to
problems
in
general
and
in
the
context
of
being
able
to
make
computers
do
what
you
want
them
to
do
students
will
get
extensive
experience
in
performing
exercises
on
the
computer
both
in
and
out
of
class
these
exercises
will
be
done
in
a
strongly
supportive
computing
environment
no
prior
experience
with
computers
is
presupposed
the
assignments
there
will
be
two
midterms
exams
each
covering
one
section
of
the
course
as
shown
on
the
schedule
over
and
a
final
exam
covering
the
third
section
plus
the
course
as
a
whole
in
addition
there
will
be
homework
assignments
every
week
or
so
for
the
first
half
of
the
course
and
some
sort
of
course
project
during
the
latter
half
exams
1
and
2
will
count
10
and
20
toward
the
course
grade
respectively
the
homework
will
count
20
and
the
project
and
final
exam
will
each
be
25
course
grades
will
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
resulting
final
distribution
of
numerical
scores
my
current
expectation
is
that
about
a
sixth
of
the
class
will
get
a
grades
that
is
a
a
or
a
about
a
third
will
get
b
grades
and
another
third
will
get
c
grades
however
i
reserve
the
right
to
adjust
these
proportions
to
better
reflect
overall
class
performance
for
example
if
it
turns
out
that
this
class
does
somewhat
better
than
expected
then
there
will
be
more
good
grades
if
it
does
worse
then
there
will
fewer
good
grades
i
will
periodically
provide
updated
information
about
the
expected
distribution
of
grades
as
we
go
along
through
the
semester
so
you
will
