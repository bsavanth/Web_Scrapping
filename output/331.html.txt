uses
of
randomness
in
complexity
theory
techniques
involving
randomness
have
played
a
crucial
role
in
complexity
theory
over
the
past
decade
they
have
been
used
to
prove
results
that
seemingly
did
not
call
for
them
such
as
toda
s
theorem
and
the
fact
that
many
np
hard
problems
are
also
np
hard
to
approximate
the
course
will
survey
these
developments
at
the
same
time
putting
them
in
context
by
also
covering
ideas
from
cryptography
interactive
proofs
and
program
checking
that
led
to
them
the
course
is
scheduled
for
tu
thurs
from
10
30
to
12
but
that
could
change
if
many
people
have
conflicts
with
that
prerequisites
solid
knowledge
of
np
completeness
and
reductions
some
mathematical
maturity
