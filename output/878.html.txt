rapid
rapid
scheduling
and
run
time
support
for
parallel
irregular
computations
this
project
focuses
on
the
study
of
scheduling
algorithms
for
exploiting
data
task
and
loop
parallelism
and
the
development
of
run
time
support
on
message
passing
architectures
the
fast
scheduling
algorithms
we
have
developed
provide
effective
utilization
of
computing
resources
for
directed
acyclic
graphs
iterative
task
graphs
with
and
without
cycles
and
task
graphs
with
data
parallelism
the
main
applications
are
targeted
at
scientific
computations
such
as
sparse
matrix
factorization
arising
from
numerical
solutions
to
nonlinear
equations
adaptive
n
body
simulations
using
the
fast
multipole
method
and
image
processing
we
are
developing
a
run
time
system
called
rapid
which
integrates
automatic
scheduling
techniques
and
efficient
communication
schemes
for
irregular
task
computations
with
mixed
granularities
on
message
passing
distributed
memory
machines
the
system
provides
a
set
of
library
functions
for
specifying
irregular
data
objects
and
tasks
that
access
these
objects
it
extracts
a
task
dependence
graph
from
data
access
patterns
and
executes
tasks
efficiently
on
a
distributed
memory
machine
our
experimental
results
on
cray
t3d
and
meiko
cs
2
indicate
that
the
system
obtains
promising
performance
in
sparse
matrix
problems
for
which
actual
speedups
have
been
hard
to
obtain
in
the
literature
in
particular
using
the
rapid
system
we
have
obtained
good
performance
for
parallel
sparse
lu
gaussian
elimination
with
partial
pivoting
which
is
an
open
parallelization
problem

scientific
computing
