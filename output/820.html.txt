split
c
is
a
parallel
extension
of
the
c
programming
language
that
supports
efficient
access
to
a
global
address
space
on
current
distributed
memory
multiprocessors
it
retains
the
small
language
character
of
c
and
supports
careful
engineering
and
optimization
of
programs
by
providing
a
simple
predictable
cost
model
this
is
in
stark
contrast
to
languages
that
rely
on
extensive
program
transformation
at
compile
time
to
obtain
performance
on
parallel
machines
split
c
programs
do
what
the
programmer
specifies
the
compiler
takes
care
of
addressing
and
communication
as
well
as
code
generation
thus
the
ability
to
exploit
parallelism
or
locality
is
not
limited
by
the
compiler
s
recognition
capability
nor
is
there
need
to
second
guess
the
compiler
transformations
while
optimizing
the
program
the
language
provides
a
small
set
of
global
access
primitives
and
simple
parallel
storage
layout
declarations
these
seem
to
capture
most
of
the
useful
elements
of
shared
memory
message
passing
and
data
parallel
programming
in
a
common
familiar
context
split
c
is
currently
implemented
on
the
thinking
machines
corp
cm
5
the
intel
paragon
the
ibm
sp
2
and
the
meiko
cs
2
and
is
under
development
on
the
cray
t3d
all
versions
are
built
using
the
free
software
foundation
s
gcc
and
the
message
passing
systems
available
on
each
machine
faster
implementations
are
underway
for
the
meiko
cs
2
using
the
elan
libraries
and
for
networks
of
workstations
using
active
messages
it
has
been
used
extensively
as
a
teaching
tool
in
parallel
computing
courses
and
hosts
a
wide
variety
of
applications
split
c
may
also
be
viewed
as
a
compilation
target
for
higher
level
parallel
languages
available
documentation
for
split
c
includes
the
following

introduces

language
