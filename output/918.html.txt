the
church
project
a
functional
programming
language
using
intersection
types
the
church
project
a
functional
programming
language
using
intersection
types
the
church
project
is
a
boston
based
project
designing
and
implementing
an
ml
like
functional
programming
language
the
input
language
is
currently
based
on
rank
2
intersection
types
while
the
typed
intermediate
language
has
intersection
union
product
sum
and
recursive
types
overview
of
language
intersection
types
are
the
basis
of
the
type
system
for
the
proposed
functional
language
it
is
a
matter
of
research
how
to
limit
and
adjust
intersection
types
to
fit
implementation
needs
the
polymorphism
provided
by
intersection
types
is
different
from
universal
quantifier
polymorphism
ml
like
languages
typically
use
a
restriction
of
the
latter
a
particular
restriction
of
intersection
types
those
of
rank
2
has
been
shown
to
be
flexible
enough
to
provide
elegant
solutions
for
several
well
known
problems
caused
by
universal
quantifier
polymorphism
in
ml
like
languages
we
have
started
the
implementation
of
a
core
language
where
the
input
uses
type
inference
for
rank
2
intersection
types
our
hope
is
that
this
flexibility
will
be
further
demonstrated
as
we
add
new
features
to
the
core
language
pointers
to
resources
the
seminar
schedule
technical
reports
a
bibliography
project
organization
the
project
is
organized
into
a
weekly
seminar
design
meetings
and
an
implementation
effort
the
seminar
is
implementation
driven
project
members
summarize
research
reports
from
the
literature
which
are
directly
relevant
to
the
implementation
joe
wells
coordinates
the
seminar
a
compiler
for
the
church
language
is
being
implemented
in
standard
ml
of
new
jersey
on
the
computers
of
the
boston
university
computer
science
department
bob
muller
coordinates
the
implementation
sometimes
the
seminar
time
is
used
as
a
working
meeting
and
sometimes
working
meetings
are
scheduled
at
other
times
project
participation
the
church
project
is
based
in
boston
and
has
active
participants
from
boston
university
boston
college
harvard
university
and
wellesley
college
new
participants
with
time
to
work
on
the
project
and
attend
the
seminar
are
welcome
for
more
information
send
e
mail
to
bob
muller
or
joe
wells
the
project
name
the
church
project
is
named
in
memory
of
alonzo
church
who
died
in
the
month
the
project
began
