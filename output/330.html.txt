they

somewhere
you
can
even
read
about

cs
people
probably
don

need
to
go

facilities
the
department
s
computers
consistly
largely
of
unix
workstations
with
some
macintoshes
and
pcs
lying
around
there
s
lots
more
to
say
about
the
facilities
but
no
one
has
written
something
down
to
reference
some
system
documentation
like

library
the

has
its
own

you
should
take
a
look
at
the
list
of
electronic
jounals
and
other
on

information
besides
all
that

ve
got

to
which
we
ve
hacked
up
a
reasonably
spiffy
way
of
finding
what
books
you
have
due
gateways
and
special
services
we
have
some
gateways
to
usenet
news
and
anonymous
ftp
that
are
must
sees
the
first
is
a
multi
part
article
decoding
service
it
tramps
through
various
newsgroups
hourly
finds
multi
part
or
encoded
articles
like
images
sounds
shar
files
and
the
like
and
assembles
them
into
an
easy
to
view
and
easy
to
download
form
the
second
is
a
gateway
to
our
anonymous
ftp
archives
at
ftp
cs
ubc

and
features
the
ability
to
browse
straight
into
zip
files
without
having
to

them
entirely

will
guide
you
to
many
other
web
servers
in

looking
for
something
but
don
t
know
where
to
start
two
suggestions
come
to
mind
first
is
the
internet
resources
meta
index
which
has
a
bunch
of
possible
starting
points
mostly
consisting
of
searchs
and
some
subject
indicies
second
is
the
collection
of
usenet
faqs
it
s
essentially
the
collected
wisdom
of
many
usenet
groups
whose
topics
are
quite
diverse
it
s
much
more
useful
than
it
sounds
