the
phoenix
project
is
being
carried
out
at
the
distributed
systems
laboratories
at
texas
a
m
university
computer
science
department
phoenix
is
an
object
oriented
environment
which
will
provide
fault
tolerance
capabilities
to
objects
phoenix
uses
spring
research
distribution
from
sun
which
is
a
object
oriented
distributed
operating
system
as
its
base
the
aim
of
phoenix
is
to
provide
fault
tolerance
to
objects
in
spring
the
fault
tolerance
in
phoenix
is
provided
at
two
levels
totally
user
application
tranparent
at
this
level
the
system
provides
fault
tolerance
for
any
object
oriented
application
that
is
developed
in
spring
fault
tolerance
is
provided
without
the
modification
of
the
source
code
thus
fault
tolerance
can
be
provided
for
a
third
party
object
whose
source
code
is
not
available
fault
tolerance
api
at
this
level
users
specifically
develop
the
application
to
tolerate
faults
using
the
library
functions
provided
by
phoenix
application
programmers
interface
apis
this
is
not
totally
user
transparent
but
will
have
a
better
performance
than
the
totally
user
transparent
one
phoenix
components
the
major
components
inter
dependent
of
the
phoenix
system
are
fault
tolerance
support
for
distributed
objects
provided
by
fto
layer
fto
layer
makes
the
objects
in
phoenix
fault
tolerant
using
checkpointing
and
message
logging
and
object
replication
it
does
so
with
minimal
disturbance
in
the
object
response
time
it
uses
the
support
provided
by
ftns
and
ftc
fault
tolerant
naming
service
provided
by
ftns
layer
this
service
helps
in
finding
replicated
objects
objects
that
are
moved
restarted
because
of
failures
this
is
done
transparent
to
the
user
fault
tolerant
communication
services
provided
by
ftc
layer
this
layer
provides
reliable
causally
totally
ordered
communication
support
for
objects
it
also
assists
fto
in
checkpointing
and
message
logging
distributed
system
health
checker
distributed
failure
detection
service
this
module
continuously
checks
the
health
of
the
system
in
a
distributed
fashion
it
informs
phoenix
of
the
faults
in
the
system
this
layer
also
helps
in
continuing
execution
