computer
science
45
and
49
students
are
expected
to
be
familiar
with
basic
concepts
from
graph
theory
discrete
mathematics
linear
algebra
and
probability
the
main
topics
of
the
course
are
paradigms
for
designing
algorithms
e
g
divide
and
conquer
greedy
method
structured
search
balancing
dynamic
programming
scaling
problem
reductions
and
the
criteria
for
their
analysis
e

the
course
deals
primarily
with
the
classical
sequential
algorithms
but
also
introduces
parallel
distributed
random
probabilistic
and
approximation
algorithms
as
time
permits
the
techniques
are
illustrated
with
algorithms
for
several
domains
drawn
from
among
information
retrieval
graphs
networks
matroids
string
matching
cryptology
arithmetic
matrices
and
algebra
