excerpt
welcome
to
cs193e
object
oriented
user
interface
programming
on
the
next
machine
in
your
typical
cs
class
you
focus
your
efforts
on
the
algorithmic
side
of
problem
solving
this
class
deals
with
a
different
type
of
program
complexity
building
programs
to
interact
with
users
the
user
takes
charge
and
the
program
must
appropriately
present
the
application
functionality
handle
user
actions
and
provide
feedback
on
those
events
the
xerox
star
the
apple
macintosh
the
varied
graphic
interfaces
of
sun
workstations
are
all
examples
of
environments
where
applications
must
support
this
user
driven
model
the
user
has
greatly
benefitted
from
the
shift
in
application
design
but
unfortunately
the
programmer
often
pays
the
price
for
this
ease
of
use
investing
months
of
engineering
time
dealing
with
the
myriad
facets
of
the
user
interface
given
that
programmers
don
t
enjoy
pain
and
re
inventing
the
wheel
the
environments
for
application
design
have
been
evolving
to
provide
better
support
for
application
development
large
toolkits
exist
for
the
mac
windows
x
etc
that
assist
in
presenting
a
consistent
interface
and
interaction
with
user
another
trend
is
the
move
towards
object
oriented
programming
object
oriented
programming
has
some
advantages
over
the
traditional
procedure
programming
mode
first
it
increases
the
modularity
of
programs
and
the
likelihood
that
modules
can
be
reused
in
other
programs
without
being
rewritten
from
scratch
second
object
oriented
programming
is
a
natural
framework
in
which
to
program
graphical
user
interfaces
graphics
elements
such
as
windows
and
menus
are
naturally
modelled
as
objects
while
clicking
with
the
mouse
can
be
viewed
simply
as
sending
a
message
to
the
object
under
the
cursor
at
the
time
of
the
click
the
object
oriented
system
bundled
with
the
next
machine
nextstep
represents
the
one
of
the
most
cohesive
object
oriented
ui
toolkits
and
appears
to
the
benchmark
to
which
other
systems
are
compared
for
this
reason
you
will
be
learning
and
using
the
next
to
explore
the
world
of
building
ui
applications
but
more
broadly
the
experience
of
working
in
an
object
oriented
toolkit
and
principles
of
user
centered
design
should
transfer
to
other
ui
environments
