this
is
the

for
paul
wilson
s
cs345
class
this
page
is
under
construction
things
are
subject
to
change
because
things
may
change
you
should
hit
the
reload
button
in
your
browser
when
you
come
to
this
page
to
make
sure
you
re
seeing
the
most
recent
version
online
course
readings
and
reference
material
syllabus
lecture
notes
on
declarative
programming
course
notes
on
scheme
and
its
implementation
in
html
for
web
browsing
these
notes
are
under
construction
only
the
first
few
sections
are
reasonably
well
indexed
for
browsing
and
the
later
sections
will
change
as
the
course
goes
along
reading
far
ahead
of
the
class
is
likely
to
be
an
adventure
i
suggest
that
you
use
this
web
page
with
a
browser
while
using
a
scheme
system
interactively
especially
while
working
through
chapter
3
the
tutorial
this
will
allow
you
to
cut
text
out
of
the
document
and
paste
it
into
a
running
scheme
system
there
are
errors
in
this
text
especially
the
later
chapters
that
s
another
reason
to
read
the
html
version
with
a
browser
rather
than
printing
out
a
hardcopy
i
ll
correct
most
of
the
errors
before
we
get
to
those
chapters
the
r4rs
scheme
language
definition
in
html
format
for
online
browsing
this
lists
all
of
the
standard
features
of
scheme
and
tersely
describes
what
they
do
for
most
stuff
in
this
course
my
scheme
course
notes
will
be
more
helpful
but
if
you
want
to
know
about
miscellanous
functions
and
exactly
what
they
do
this
is
the

on

which
you
should

the
main
language
we
ll
be
using
in
this
course
is
scheme
and
by
default
the
implementation
to
use
is
rscheme
which
is
installed
on
the
public
cs
sparcs
running
solaris
and
rs6000
s
running
aix
on
the
cs
machine
you
run
rscheme
with
the
command
p
bin
runscheme
if
you
use
your
own
machine
and
you
re
running
linux
or
solaris
or
any
of
several
other
implementations
of
unix
you
can
get
rscheme
and
install
it
on
your
machine
it
s
free
you
can
find
it
from
donovan
kolbly
s
home
page
be
sure
to
get
version
0
7
or
later
and
ask
the
ta
zhu
qing
for
a
patch
to
make
it
friendlier
for
newbies
if
you
re
using
your
own
machine
and
it
s
a
mac
i
recommend
getting
gambit
marc
feeley
s
implementation
of
scheme
it
s
free
too
you
can
get
it
from
the
scheme
repository
see
below
if
you
re
using
a
pc
running
windows
or
dos
i
m
not
sure
what
the
best
scheme
to
get
is
there
are
a
bunch
available
at
the
scheme
repository
do
not
use
mit
scheme
or
guile
they
re
not
standard
scheme
you
might
try
gambit
c
by
mark
feeley
or
mzscheme
from
rice
if
you
use
something
besides
rscheme
i
recommend
getting
the
meroon
version
3
object
system
from
the
scheme
repository
when
we
start
doing
object
oriented
programming
for
a
few
assignments
you
may
have
to
use
rscheme
under
unix
to
take
advantage
of
rscheme
s
object
system
but
for
most
things
you
should
be
able
to
use
meroon
the
scheme
repository
the
scheme
repository
at
the
university
of
indiana
has
lots
of
free
implementations
of

and
various

on
