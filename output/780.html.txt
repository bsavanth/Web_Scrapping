this
course
covers
the
fundamental
techniques
for
designing
and
analyzing
geometric
algorithms
in
two
three
and
higher
dimensions
we
will
give
an
in
depth
coverage
of
basic
geometric
data
structures
such
as
convex
hulls
arrangements
voronoi
and
delaunay
diagrams
flat
and
hierarchical
triangulations
partition
trees
etc
we
will
also
survey
several
important
paradigms
of
geometric
algorithm
design
including
sweep
line
plane
methods
randomized
techniques
cuttings
and
their
applications
parametric
searching
and
various
geometric
optimization
methods
we
will
motivate
the
material
with
example
problems
drawn
from
application
areas
such
as
robotics
graphics
vision
and
geography
and
discuss
some
of
the
non
trivial
issues
involved
in
implementing
geometric

outline
there
is
now
so
much
material
in
computational
geometry
that
probably
a
full
year
course
is
needed
to
cover
all
the
basic
techniques
nevertheless
given
some
algorithmic
preparation
we
can
cover
lots
of
ground
even
in
one
quarter
below
is
a
list
of
topics
to
be
covered
but
we
do
not
promise
to
cover
them
in
the
order
listed

two
and
three

text
the
main
text
for
the
course
is
a
reader
comprised
of
a
number
of
survey
articles
plus
lecture
notes
scribed
with
the
help
of
students
in
previous
years
of
this
class
a
second
recommended
reader
is
a
preprint
of
the
forthcoming
book
computational
geometry
by
example
by
mark
de
berg
mark
van
kreveld
mark
overmars
and
otfried
schwarzkopf
this
book
uses
examples
from
application
areas
to
motivate
all
the
main
structures
and
techniques
of
computational
geometry
and
may
become
the
main
text
for
this
course
in
future
years
these
two
readers
are
available
at
the
stanford
bookstore
homeworks
exams
grading
etc
the
course
will
have
three
substantial
and
mathematically
challenging
homeworks
of
the
pencil
and
paper
type
there
will
be
no
final
exam
but
there
will
be
a
midterm
whose
function
will
be
to
test
breath
but
not
depth
for
the
final
grade
we
will
count
each
of
the
homeworks
and
the
midterm
as
25
of
the
grade
please
do
the
homework
there
is
no
other
way
to
learn
the
material
