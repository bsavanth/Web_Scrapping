algorithms

matrices
algorithms
for
quadtree
representation
of
matrices
description
rather
than
decomposing
matrices
into
rows
columns
or
tiny
blocks
we
decompose
them
recursively
into
quadrants
the
array
becomes
a
tree
which
still
might
be
stored
sequentially
and
decompostion
of
the
problem
for
multiprocessing
follows
the
subtrees
we
explore
this
structure
as
an
exercise
of
the
thesis
that
functional
programming
is
ideal
for
multiprocessing
the
resulting
algorithms
are
expressed
in
c
for
better
performance
opportunites
for
new
algorithms
abound
sparse
matrices
have
many
empty
subtrees
and
simple
algebra
there
so
uniform
algorithms
can
be
applied
to
both
sparse
and
nonsparse
problems
search
problems
e
g
pivoting
steer
by
summary
information
that
decorates
interior
nodes
of
the
tree
under
gaussian
elimination
a
nonsingular
subtree
of
any
order
can
be
eliminated
at
any
step
the
resulting
undulant
pivoting
has
been
developed
for
both
exact
and
floating
point
decomposition
