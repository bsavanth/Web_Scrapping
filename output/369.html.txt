page
coordination
in
parallel
programs
coordination
refers
to
those
features
of
parallel
programs
involving
multiple
processes
namely
communication
synchronization
and
scheduling
for
simple
programs
with
regular
data
access
patterns
coordination
structures
can
be
determined
at
compile
time
and
require
little
runtime
support
for
applications
with
irregular
data
access
patterns
for
example
loops
that
iterate
over
portions
of
an
array
or
dynamic
data
structures
some
coordination
decisions
are
best
left
until
runtime
necessitating
more
powerful
runtime
support
and
more
sophisticated
compile
time
analysis
in
this
project
coordination
is
provided
by
delirium
a
coordination
language
for
expressing
scheduling
and
communication
patterns
by
adaptive
runtime
scheduling
and
by
multipol
a
distributed
data
structure
library
some
of
the
software
developed
in
this
project
is
being
integrated
with
other
parallel
software
efforts
at

application
studies
are
used
extensively
in
this

to
test
our
ideas
some
of
the
recent
applications
include
the
grobner
basis
problem
timing
level
circuit
simulation
the
phylogeny
problem
magnet
simulation
and
cell
simulation
