caltech
infospheres
project
bringing
theory
to
the
marketplace
the
caltech
infospheres
project
deals
with
the
theory
and
implementation
of
compositional
systems
that
support
peer
to
peer
communication
among
persistent
multithreaded
distributed
objects
though
our
implementation
of
a
generic
distributed
system
uses
java
tcp
ip
and
the
web
the
ideas
are
directly
applicable
to
any
distributed
possibly
object
oriented
system
that
supports
messages
and
threads
a
key
concern
is
the
development
of
reliable
distributed
applications
by
composing
existing
and
created
software
components
in
structured
ways
we
are
solving
the
problems
and
influencing
the
standards
of
distributed
component
technology
for
the
user
and
developer
for
the
internet
of
the
21
st
century
an
executive
summary
of
the
infospheres
project
is
available
release

b1
of
the
infosphere
infrastructure
ii
is
now
available
the
caltech
infospheres
infrastructure
ii
is
a
distributed
system
framework
that
is
implemented
in
java
it
provides
a
generic
object
model
and
a
variety
of
messaging
models
asynchronous
synchronous
and
remote
procedure
calls
this
system
is
freely
available
so
that
researchers
and
developers
can
develop
lightweight
distributed
systems
that
can
leverage
open
standards
and
the
world
wide
web
caltech
is
developing
methodologies
that
take
advantage
of
the
system
s
design
so
that
reasoning
on
entire
distributed
systems
is
feasible
with
these
methodologies
one
can
say
something
about
the
reliability
completeness
and
robustness
of
a
distributed
system
as
a
whole
the
ii
is
being
extended
to
support
interoperability
with
other
distributed
system
models
and
to
utilize
emerging
standards
in
the
java
domain
because
the
system
is
designed
and
implemented
in
a
generic
manner
the
ideas
algorithms
and
theories
developed
within
the
ii
framework
are
directly
applicable
to
existing
distributed
systems
and
frameworks
the
caltech
infospheres
project
is
part
of
the
compositional
systems
research
group
of
the
center
for
research
on
parallel
computation
led
by
professor
k
mani
chandy
other
projects
in
which
the
compositional
systems
group
works
include
problem
solving
environments
archetypes
and
our
infosphere
infrastructure
the
contributions
of
the
infospheres
group
are
both
theoretical
and
experimental
we
have
an
extensive
set
of
papers
and
our
infosphere
infrastructure
is
available
for
non
commercial
purposes
