students
who
follow
this
scheme
will
get
the
most
out
of
both
the
lecture
and
the
lab
general
course
goals
i
hope
to
accomplish
several
things
in
this
course
since
this
is
the
first
time
we
ve
done
it
it
s
impossible
to
predict
just
how
much
we
will
be
able
to
cover
in
general
there
are
two
areas
i
want
cover
the
technical
and
the
practical
in
many
cases
these
are
related
but
not
always
the
technical
amounts
to
the
how
to
aspect
of
any
class
we
want
to
learn
how
things
work
and
how
to
use
them
the
practical
is
more
ethereal
it
s
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
t
or
don
t
usually
get
in
technical
classes
ideas
about
problem
solving
professional
growth
and
development
on
the
job
all
those
things
you
need
to
know
about
if
you
re
really
going
to
do
network
administration
as
all
or
part
of
your
job
technical
course
goals
the
technical
goal
of
this
course
is
very
practical
in
nature
we
want
you
to
learn
about
networks
this
includes
some
hardware
networking
topologies
networking
protocols
network
operating
systems
and
desktop
operating
systems
when
you
complete
this
course
you
will
have
worked
to
some
degree
with
novell
netware
3
12
windows
3
1
windows95
windows
nt
workstation
windows
nt
advanced
server
and
macintosh
os
you
will
have
a
working
knowledge
of
these
systems
some
more
than
others
i
will
try
to
make
this
experience
as
practical
as
possible
using
what
i
know
about
systems
currently
in
place
in
both
business
and
education
so
that
when
you
are
done
you
can
honestly
say
you
have
some
useful
networking
knowledge
and
experience
grading
ughhh
i
know
this
is
never
fun
but
here
s
what
i
have
in
mind
at
this
point
there
will
probably
be
weekly
or
bi
weekly
homework
assignments
that
will
be
graded
and
represent
15
25
of
the
course
grade
the
labs
will
probably
not
be
graded
since
the
goal
is
use
and
hands
on
experience
however
what
you
do
in
the
labs
will
appear
on
the
exams
or
homework
or
both
so
you
ll
still
have
to
learn
this
stuff
there
will
probably
be
3
4
exams
representing
75
85
of
the
course
grade
evenly
distributed
across
all
the
exams
so
there
will
probably
not
be
a
so
called
comprehensive
final
instead
the
3
rd
or
4
th
exam
will
take
place
during
the
final
exam
time
however
it
s
my
custom
to
design
my
classes
so
each
section
builds
on
the
previous
in
other
words
even
though
the
last
exam
won
t
be
a
final
it
s
unlikely
you
ll
pass
it
unless
you
ve
done
well
on
the
previous
exams
labs
and
homework
you
ll
have
to
know
what
we
ve
already
learned
to
keep
up
finally
don
t
let
any
of
the
above
scare
you
away
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
anyone
enrolled
in
the
course
this
semester
or
interested
in
this
course
in
the
future
has
a
decent
amount
of
information
to
make
an
informed
decision
in
response
to
the
demand
for
this
course
at
this
time
it
appears
it
will
be
offered
every
semester
at
this
time
two
sections
of
this
course
will
be
offered
during
spring
