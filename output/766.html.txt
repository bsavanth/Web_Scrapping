overview
the
crucial
problem
facing
today
s
high
speed
microprocessors
is
maintaining
high
processor
utilization
in
the
face
of
long
instruction
and
memory
latencies
to
alleviate
this
problem
modern
processors
issue
multiple
instructions
per
cycle
i
e
superscalars
or
interleave
the
execution
of
different
threads
in
different
cycles
multithreaded
processors
ultimately
though
both
techniques
are
limited
by
the
amount
of
parallelism
available
within
a
single
thread
in
a
single
cycle
simultaneous
multithreading
smt
is
a
technique
that
permits
multiple
independent
threads
to
issue
instructions
to
a
superscalar
s
functional
units
in
a
single
cycle
smt
combines
the
multiple
instruction
issue
features
of
wide
superscalar
processors
with
the
latency
hiding
ability
of
multithreaded
architectures
on
an
smt
processor
all
hardware
contexts
are
active
simultaneously
competing
each
cycle
for
all
available
resources
this
dynamic
sharing
of
processor
resources
enables
smt
to
exploit
thread
level
and
instruction
level
parallelism
interchangeably
both
forms
of
parallelism
can
be
effectively
used
to
increase
processor
utilization
our
studies
have
demonstrated
that
simultaneous
multithreading
significantly
improves
processor
throughput
and
performance
on
both
multiprogrammed
and
parallel
workloads
we
have
shown
that
these
performance
gains
can
be
achieved
in
an
architecture
with
only
minimal
extensions
to
modern
out
of
order
superscalar
processors
our
current
and
future
work
includes
investigations
of
fast
synchronization
techniques
enabled
by
smt
we
are
also
conducting
research
in
other
architectural
and
compiler
