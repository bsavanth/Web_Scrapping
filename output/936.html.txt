the
horus
project
the
company
of
the
gods
rejoiced
rejoiced
at
the
coming
of
horus
the
son
of
osiris
whose
heart
was
firm
the
triumphant
the
son
of
isis
the
heir
of
osiris
185
the
horus
project
has
developed
a
modular
and
extensible
process
group
communication
system
addressing
the
requirements
of
a
wide
variety
of
robust
distributed
applications
horus
the
son
of
isis
and
of
osiris
was
a
god
whose
attributes
appealed
strongly
to
the
egyptians
from
one
end
of
egypt
to
the
other
because
in
him
every
man
and
woman
saw
the
type
of
what
he
or
she
wished
to
possess
that
is
to
say
renewed
life
and
life
as
opposed
to
death
and
movement
as
opposed
to
inactivity
178
horus
provides
a
framework
for
the
development
of
distributed
applications
based
on
group
communications
a
style
of
computing
that
can
arise
in
fault
tolerant
systems
managed
distributed
systems
applications
that
exploit
data
replication
or
coherent
caching
and
groupware
within
the
overall
horus
framework
a
large
collection
of
system
and
application
protocols
have
been
developed
that
allow
the
application
designer
to
construct
a
communication
module
that
exactly
meets
the
application
requirements
at
minimal
cost
the
horus
project
was
originally
launched
as
an
effort
to
redesign
the
isis
group
communication
system
but
has
evolved
into
a
general
purpose
communication
architecture
with
advanced
support
for
the
development
of
robust
distributed
systems
in
settings
for
which
isis
was
unsuitable
such
as
applications
that
have
special
security
or
real
time
requirements
besides
the
practical
uses
of
our
software
the
project
has
contributed
towards
the
theory
of
virtually
synchrony
a
runtime
model
used
for
our
implementation
of
data
replication
and
fault
tolerance
at
the
same
time
our
software
is
much
faster
and
lighter
weight
than
the
isis
system
horus
exists
as
two
systems
an
initial
version
coded
in
c
which
can
be
used
for
research
purposes
at
no
fee
but
has
restricted
commerical
rights
and
a
new
version
called
ensemble
written
in
ml
but
usable
from
many
other
languages
which
is
available
for
all
classes
of
users
at
no
fee
ensemble
is
actively
under
development
and
we
will
do
series
of
releases
over
the
fall
of
1996
and
spring
of
1997
by
early
in
1997
ensemble
will
be
an
outstanding
environment
for
building
java
based
groupware
applications
that
do
multimedia
conferencing
on
the
web
horus
and
ensemble
are
designed
to
be
platform
independent
and
are
available
for
different
classes
of
workstations
personal
computers
parallel
processors
and
on
next
generation
cluster
environments
using
standard
high
speed
communications
networks
the
horus
effort
collaborates
closely
with
many
other
distributed
systems
projects
including
transis
navtech
and
the
stormcast
and
tacoma
projects
links
to
these
and
other
projects
can
be
found
elsewhere
in
these
pages
of
the
circumstances
under
which
horus
was
begotten
we
gain
a
good
idea
from
a
hym
to
osiris
in
which
the
sorrow
of
his
mother
isis
at
the
death
of
her
husband
is
described
the
goddess
was
greatly
distressed
but
she
was
equipped
with
mighty
words
of
power
and
she
knew
how
to
utter
them
so
that
they
might
have
the
greatest
effect
and
she
set
out
in
search
of
the
dead
body
of
osiris
and
never
rested
until
she
had
found
him
with
her
hair
she
made
light
and
with
her
wings
she
stirred
the
air
as
she
made
lamentation
for
her
brother
osiris
and
at
length
she
brought
his
body
into
a
state
of
activity
and
was
them
united
to
him
thus
she
became
with
child
by
him
and
her
son
horus
was
born
in
a
secret
place
where
she
suckled
him
and
reared
him
