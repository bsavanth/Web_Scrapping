introduction
and
goals
the
purpose
of
this
three
year
reseach
project
1994
1996
is
to
develop
a
framework
and
systematic
methodology
to
facilitate
the
application
of
multidisciplinary
design
optimization
mdo
to
a
diverse
class
of
system
design
problems
mdo
is
based
upon
the
philosophy
of
identifying
the
appropriate
combination
of
parameters
which
are
under
the
control
of
a
designer
or
design
team
and
which
will
result
in
the
most
effective
product
or
system
for
all
practical
aerospace
systems
the
design
of
a
systems
is
a
complex
sequence
of
events
which
integrates
the
activities
of
a
variety
of
discipline
experts
and
their
associated
tools
the
development
archiving
and
exchange
of
information
between
these
individual
experts
is
central
to
the
design
task
it
is
this
information
which
provides
the
basis
for
these
experts
to
make
their
design
decisions
resulting
in
the
final
product
the
development
of
mdo
has
been
inextricably
tied
to
developments
in
computer
hardware
and
software
advanced
analysis
tools
such
as
computational
fluid
dynamics
cfd
and
finite
element
analysis
fea
have
now
been
integrated
into
the
daily
activities
of
many
designers
however
design
decisions
are
often
based
on
a
variety
of
information
sources
analytic
numerical
simulation
design
heuristic
or
even
intuition
the
development
and
integration
of
this
information
using
high
powered
computing
tools
has
begun
to
demonstrate
the
true
potential
of
mdo
a
variety
of
methods
and
applications
are
being
considered
in
each
case
the
fundamental
approach
is
to
provide
the
individual
discipline
expert
with
the
information
necessary
to
evaluate
the
system
as
a
whole
and
to
be
able
to
understand
the
impact
of
individual
decisions
on
the
overall
system
design
the
methods
being
considered
include
extensions
to
global
sensitivity
equations
gse
the
application
of
artificial
neural
networks
for
design
space
mapping
and
the
integration
of
distributed
computing
and
process
scheduling
into
the
mdo
environment
the
current
research
effort
is
a
joint
program
between
the
departments
of
aerospace
and
mechanical
engineering
and
the
computer
science
and
engineering
departments
at
the
university
of
notre
dame
the
coordination
of
efforts
within
the
project
is
based
upon
identification
of
a
series
of
demonstration
problems
the
formulation
of
a
number
of
mdo
algorithms
and
specific
design
tool
development
test
problem
and
algorithm
development
provide
a
focus
for
the
efforts
of
each
of
these
individual
researchers
these
problems
are
being
selected
so
that
they
represent
a
diverse
spectrum
of
mdo
applications
and
will
present
a
variety
of
challenges
for
the
methods
being
developed
and
evaluated
as
part
of
this
research
program
as
this
three
year
program
continues
information
related
to
each
of
the
primary
phases
of
the
project
will
be
added
to
this
document
the
results
of
those
issues
identified
as
future
efforts
will
be
used
to
assess
applicability
of
the
mdo
tools
to
a
wide
variety
of
applications
a
number
of
references
are
available
which
outline
various
developments
associated
with
this
research
program
the
annual
report
which
summarizes
the
research
activities
from
october
1994
to
october

can

accessed
and
the

used
for
the
annual
presentation
at

are
being

the
following
are
a
selection
of
recent
publications
developed
as
part
of
this
research
program
many
are
attached
as

and
if
you
have
a

they
should
be
