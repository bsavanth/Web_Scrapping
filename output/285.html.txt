between

however
differences
in

often

this
paper
introduces
a
simple
extension
to
image
morphing
that
correctly
handles
3

projective
camera
and
scene
transformations
the
technique
called
em
view
morphing
works
by
prewarping
two
images
prior
to
computing
a
morph
and
then
postwarping
the
interpolated
images
because
no
knowledge
of
3
d
shape
is
required
the
technique
may
be
applied
to
photographs
and
drawings
as
well
as
rendered

the
ability
to
synthesize
changes
both
in

and

affords
