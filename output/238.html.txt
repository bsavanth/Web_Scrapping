the
nyu
ultracomputer
project
the
nyu
ultracomputer
lab
conducts
research
in
parallel
computer
architecture
and
software
design
specifically
we
have
constructed
two
generations
of
shared
memory
machines
an
8
processor
bus
based
machine
in
the
1980
s
and
our
current
prototype
a
16
processor
16
memory
module
machine
with
custom
vlsi
switches
supporting
the
fetch
and
add
coordination
primitive
this
design
allows
for
a
reduction
in
memory
hot
spot
contention
by
interleaving
memory
addresses
between
the
memory
modules
and
using
the
network
switches
to
combine
requests
destined
for
the
same
memory
location
the
ultracomputer
runs
symunix
a
locally
developed
parallel
version
of
unix
we
have
information
available
on
staff
and
students
