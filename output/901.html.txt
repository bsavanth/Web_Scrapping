general
information
course
description
this
course
is
for
students
interested
in
designing
computer
algorithms
and
analyzing
their
efficiencies
the
study
of
algorithms
is
at
the
very
heart
of
computer
science
the
course
will
cover
basic
algorithm
design
techniques
including
divide
and
conquer
recurrence
dynamic
programming
greedy
algorithms
and
reduction
to
known
problems
as
well
as
basic
algorithm
analysis
techniques
including
worst
case
analysis
average
case
analysis
and
probabilistic
analysis
we
will
study
various
searching
and
sorting
algorithms
as
well
as
a
number
of
graph
algorithms

a
clarification
this
course
does
not
have
programming
projects
however
if
you
like
programming
you
should
know
that
algorithms
are
written
as
pseudo
code
and
if
you
are
good
at
them
you
can
turn
them
into
real
code
easily
these
algorithms
are
used
in
many
applications
and
there
are
programs
written
for
them
already
you
may
play
with
those
programs
if
you
like
but
you
will
have
to
know
the
algorithms
to
understand
how
the
programs
work
tentative
course
outline
we
will
first
introduce
analysis
of
algorithms
this
includes
asymptotic
notation
summations
and
recurrences
counting
and
probability
lower
bounds
they
will
not
be
introduced
in
abstract
instead
we
will
discuss
sorting
and
related
algorithms
insertion
sort
mergesort
quicksort
heapsort
median
and
order
statistics
as
well
as
strassen
s
matrix
multiplication
algorithms

we
will
then
discuss
data
structures
they
include
hash
tables
binary
search
trees
red
black
trees
skip
lists
and
augmenting
data
structures
the
last
piece
will
start
the
study
of
algorithm
design
although
some
design
techniques
recurrence
divide
and
conquer
will
have
been
covered
while
introducing
analysis
techniques
part

we
will
then
study
advanced
algorithm
design
techniques
dynamic
programming
greedy
algorithms
and
analysis
techniques
amortized
analysis
these
techniques
will
not
be
introduced
in
abstract
instead
we
will
discuss
problems
such
as
longest
common
subsequence
activity
selection
and
minimum
spanning
tree
this
last
example
will
start
study
of
graph
algorithms
part

we
will
then
discuss
graph
algorithms
this
include
basic
algorithms
like
depth
first
search
breadth
first
search
topological
sort
and
strongly
connected
components
as
well
as
more
advanced
algorithms
for
single
source
all
pairs
shortest
paths
problems
and
network
flow
problems
part

we
will
at
the
end
introduce
a
few
selected
topics
possible
choices
are
parallel
algorithms
incremental
dynamic
algorithms
polynomials
and
fft
string
matching
and
computational
geometry
