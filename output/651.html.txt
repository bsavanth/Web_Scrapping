the
resource
bounded
reasoning
research
group
is
part
of
the
department
of
computer
science
at
the
university
of
massachusetts
amherst
the
group
headed
by
professor
shlomo
zilberstein
studies
the
implications
of
limited
computational
resources
on
the
design
of
intelligent
agents
the
group
conducts
research
in
decision
theory
real
time
planning
autonomous
agent
architectures
and
reasoning
under
uncertainty
what
is
resource
bounded
reasoning
resource
bounded
reasoning
is
an
emerging
field
within
artificial
intelligence
that
is
concerned
with
the
construction
of
intelligent
systems
that
can
operate
in
real
time
environments
under
uncertainty
and
limited
computational
resources
research
in
this
field
covers
the
construction
composition
and
meta
level
control
of
computational
methods
that
allow
small
quantities
of
computational
commodities
such
as
time
memory
or
information
to
be
traded
for
gains
in
the
value
of
computed
results
why
is
it
needed
the
need
to
employ
resource
bounded
reasoning
techniques
is
based
on
a
simple
but
general
observation
in
many
complex
domains
the
computational
resources
required
to
reach
an
optimal
decision
reduce
the
overall
utility
of
the
result
this
observation
covers
a
wide
range
of
applications
such
as
medical
diagnosis
and
treatment
combinatorial
optimization
probabilistic
inference
mobile
robot
navigation
and
information
gathering
what
is
common
to
all
these
problems
is
that
it
is
not
feasible
computationally
or
desirable
economically
to
compute
the
optimal
answer
moreover
taking
the
cost
of
decision
making
into
account
is
not
an
easy
task
since
the
optimal
level
of
deliberation
varies
from
situation
to
situation
it
is
therefore
beneficial
to
build
systems
that
can
tradeoff
computational
resources
for
quality
of
results
advantages
of
resource
bounded
reasoning
from
the
early
days
of
ai
heuristic
methods
and
satisficing
techniques
have
been
used
to
address
the
problem
of
computational
complexity
resource
bounded
reasoning
techniques
have
two
important
advantages
over
those
previous
approaches
they
shift
the
attention
from
design
time
solutions
to
more
flexible
run
time
solutions
and
they
seek
to
optimize
rather
than
satisfice
solution
quality
the
shift
to
run
time
control
of
deliberation
improves
the
capability
of
intelligent
systems
to
deal
with
two
primary
sources
of
uncertainty
the
first
source
is
internal
to
the
system
and
relates
to
its
capability
to
produce
incrementally
improving
solutions
and
to
assess
their
quality
the
second
source
of
uncertainty
is
external
and
relates
to
unpredictable
change
in
the
environment
in
which
the
system
operates
run
time
control
of
deliberation
seeks
to
reduce
the
effect
of
these
uncertainties
on
the
performance
of
the
system
optimization
of
decision
quality
is
another
distinctive
feature
of
resource
bounded
reasoning
that
is
instead
of
building
systems
that
find
a
good
answer
the
goal
of
resource
bounded
reasoning
techniques
is
to
find
an
optimal
answer
optimality
however
is
defined
with
respect
to
the
system
knowledge
and
computational
capabilities
typically
an
optimal
answer
does
not
require
maximal
solution
quality
hence
these
systems
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
bounded
optimal
or
bounded
rational
