research
on
ubiquitous
telepresence
ut
project
statement
the
main
idea
of
ubiquitous
telepresence
ut
is
to
allow
users
to
project
their
physical
presence
anywhere
on
the
internet
specifically
users
are
given
the
ability
to
explore
and
interact
with
many
remote
physical
environments
e
g
all
sites
on
the
internet
through
remote
sensing
and
manipulation
devices
the
plan
for
implementing
ubiquitous
telepresence
is
to
build
robotic
or
remote
controlled
units
which
we
have
called
ubots
at
such
low
cost
that
they
become
as
ubiquitous
as
television
sets
