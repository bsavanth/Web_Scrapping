overview
this
instance
of
the
seminar
will
revolve
around
the
theme
of
distributed
cooperation
among
parallel
program
threads
among
human
users
and
among
information
servers
the
goals

meanings
of
such
cooperation
vary
tremendously

the
problems
that
arise
in

different
contexts
seem
to
recur
we
will
range
over
the
fields

computing
distributed

three
themes

us
ground
our
exploration
parallel
