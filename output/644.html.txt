course
overview
the
content
of
this
course
will
depend
largely
on
student
backgrounds
in
any
case
we
will
take
an
in
depth
look
at
design
and
implementation
issues
for
object
oriented
programming
languages
your
core
activity
will
be
to
implement
a
variety
of
object
oriented
language
mechanisms
using
scheme
we
will
develop
a
core
language
implementation
and
the
programming
assignments
will
typically
involve
extending
this
core
in
various
ways
this
should
give
you
a
chance
to
spend
less
time
coding
and
more
time
thinking
we
will
spend
a
significant
part
of
our
lecture
time
discussing
the
assignments
and
presenting
solutions
the
problems
tend
to
be
open
ended
and
we
learn
a
lot
from
seeing
how
others
approach
a
problem
these
are
not
formal
presentations
and
you
should
come
to
every
class
prepared
to
present
your
current
work
around
the
middle
of
the
term
you
will
also
be
asked
to
pick
a
topic
for
a
short
paper
the
paper
will
address
one
of
the
topics
raised
in
the
course
and
should
involve
a
literature
survey
as
well
as
some
original
thought
the
paper
will
be
due
by
the
end
of
finals
week
i
will
probebly
require
paper
drafts
at
some
point
in
november
so
i
can
give
you
some
early
feedback

to
setup
