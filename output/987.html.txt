cornell
modeling
and
simulation
project
enormous
effort
is
currently
expended
in
creating
scientific
software
particularly
for
simulating
physical
systems
defined
on
complex
geometries
and
when
using
advanced
computing
hardware
the
goal
of
the
simlab
project
is
to
reduce
this
effort
by
bringing
together
technologies
such
as
geometric
modeling
symbolic
mathematics
numerical
analysis
compilation
code
generation
and
formal
methods
to
create
tools
that
raise
the
semantic
level
at
which
it
is
possible
to
create
scientific
software
