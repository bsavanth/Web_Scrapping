overview
computer
science
552
offers
an
opportunity
to
learn
about
operating
systems
by
designing
and
building
various
os
components
in
addition
to
studying
their
conceptual
and
theoretical
underpinnings
an
operating
system
controls
and
operates
disparate
hardware
resources
so
as
to
shield
programs
and
users
from
idiosyncrasies
of
individual
devices
and
from
such
nasty
phenomena
as
concurrency
asynchrony
and
failure
by
hiding
detailed
hardware
features
and
behaviors
the
os
provides
an
interface
that
constitutes
an
abstraction
of
the
hardware
in
this
course
we
will
study
the
design
and
construction
of
major
subsystems
of
an
operating
system
and
examine
some
of
the
core
problems
in
detail
we
will
not
focus
on
the
difficulties
of
integrating
the
various
subsystems
into
a
coherent
whole
as
we
might
do
if
this
were
a
project
course
while
these
difficulties
are
critical
for
a
complete
understanding
of
operating
systems
we
would
risk
excluding
issues
of
fundamental
and
current
concern
from
the
limited
scope
of
attention
available
in
a
course
therefore
the
course
will
revolve
around
weekly
and
bi
weekly
assignments
consisting
of
alternating
design
implementation
and
analysis

the

so
please
acknowledge

i
encourage
you
to

in

to

advantage
i
e
cheating
or
plagiarism
the
rule
is
simple
produce
the
actual
solution
in
isolation
from
others
work
that
is
what
you
submit
should
be
entirely
your
original
expression
except
for
what
you
specifically
credit
to
other
sources
for
example
copying
without
attribution
any
part
however
small
of
someone
else
s
program
constitutes
plagiarism
even
if
you
modify
it
and
even
if
the
source
is
a
textbook
standards
of
academic
conduct
treat
cheating
and
plagiarism
very
seriously
because
they
impede
the
drive
for
originality
and
invention
that
have
been
the
hallmark
of
human
