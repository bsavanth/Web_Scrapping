graphics
package
requirements
general
overview
the
objective
of
these
requirements
is
to
allow
you
to
design
and
implement
a
basic
but
useful
three
dimensional
graphics
package
emphasis
is
given
to
fundamental
computer
graphics
elements
that
are
common
to
all
general
purpose
3
d
computer
graphics
packages
this
course
does
not
emphasize
documentation
or
software
design
nor
does
it
emphasize
user
interfaces
these
are
appropriate
subjects
for
other
courses
and
are
of
obvious
importance
the
goal
of
this
course
is
to
allow
you
to
gain
an
understanding
of
the
important
fundamental
algorithms
and
techniques
used
in
computer
graphics
now
a
warning
to
the
wise
concerning
some
things
you
should
do
so
that
you
have
a
pleasant
experience
in
this
course
first
scan
ahead
and
read
all
parts
of
the
text
that
have
something
to
do
with
your
implementation
this
saves
you
from
realizing
down
the
road
that
the
architecture
of
your
package
cannot
easily
accommodate
a
new
capability
that
must
be
incorporated
understand
all
the
elements
and
how
they
will
fit
together
from
the
start
design
your
package
ahead
of
time
this
task
though
time
consuming
saves
you
a
lot
of
headaches
later
on
there
simply
is
not
enough
time
in
the
semester
to
finish
your
package
if
you
wait
until
a
concept
is
discussed
in
class
before
you
begin
to
think
about
it
or
to
implement
it
while
this
philosophy
may
be
odd
to
some
this
is
the
only
way
you
can
produce
a
good
package
in
this
class
given
the
unavoidable
time
constraints
common
to
university
courses
and
to
actual
production
environments
second
start
early
the
pass
off
deadlines
come
up
very
fast
try
always
to
keep
a
couple
of
weeks
ahead
so
that
you
aren
t
caught
short
and
so
that
you
have
time
left
at
the
end
of
the
semester
to
meet
your
other
responsibilities
third
make
your
code
robust
use
good
sense
and
your
knowledge
of
good
program
design
finally
do
not
limit
yourself
to
the
course
textbook
read
other
texts
and
any
other
material
that
may
give
more
information
on
a
subject
or
explain
it
better
other
sources
can
be
of
great
value
to
you
for
your
implementation
machines
and
languages
students
may
use
any
machines
or
languages
that
are
capable
of
accommodating
the
package
requirements
and
to
which
they
have
authorized
access
for
cs
455
to
make
pass
offs
manageable
for
the
ta
you
must
pass
off
your
package
on
a
computer
located
on
byu
s
campus
which
you
have
authorized
access
to
if
you
develop
your
package
on
a
computer
at
home
please
make
sure
that
there
is
a
compatible
computer
which
will
run
your
package
on
campus
otherwise
you
will
be
under
the
necessity
of
transporting
your
computer
to
campus
for
each
pass
off
which
might
not
be
convenient
for
you
unless
the
computer
is
a
laptop
the
display
device
should
be
capable
of
displaying
at
least
256
different
colors
at
a
resolution

at

interface
and
pass
off
procedure
a
static
demo
is
not
sufficient
for
pass
off
your
implementation
must
be
somewhat
interactive
the
objective
of
the
pass
off
is
to
demonstrate
the
robustness
of
your
implementation
by
performing
arbitrary
graphics
functions
there
are
several
options
you
may
choose
from
depending
on
your
preferences
and
development
environment
1
gui
you
may
use
mouse
keyboard
menus
dialogs
or
any
controls
you
wish
however
this
is
not
required
it
is
assumed
that
this
interface
will
be
intuitive
the
supported
commands
and
their
optional
parameters
will
be
tested
using
the
gui
2
script
file
you
may
create
and
process
a
simple
script
file
to
demonstrate
the
functionality
of
your
software
please
provide
the
syntax
or
sample
commands
that
can
be
processed
from
the
script
file
the
supported
commands
and
their
optional
parameters
will
be
tested
by
editing
the
script
files
and
then
processing
them
3
command
line
you
may
use
a
command
line
interface
if
you
choose
this
option
please
include
the
ability
to
print
out
the
commands
and
parameters
on
a
simple
help
screen
the
supported
commands
and
their
optional
parameters
will
be
tested
using
the
command
line
interface
this
is
the
least
convenient
implementation
about
one
week
before
pass
off
the
ta
will
supply
the
students
with
a
pass
off
sign
up
sheet
you
will
be
required
to
turn
in
an
electronic
copy
of
your
code
however
there
are
no
special
code
or
documentation
requirements
grading
of
programming
assignments
each
assignment
must
be
completed
by
the
due
date
or
late
days
will
be
charged
the
indicates
functions
which
you
must
provide
all
required
functionality
must
be
completed
the
balance
of
points
for
each
section
may
be
earned
by
completing
optional
items
listed
in
each
category
you
may
also
propose
additional
options
in
writing
which
if
approved
in
advance
may
count
toward
the
total
of
optional
points
there
are
85
points
for
each
of
the
four
phases
for
a
total
of
340
possible
points
note
that
phase
4
gives
you
three
different
options
to
choose
from
each
option
is
worth
85
points
choose
only
one
of
them
up
to
20
points
may
be
deducted
for
each
assignment
if
the
interface
does
not
facilitate
adequate
testing
of
the
functionality
for
example
drawing
a
line
must
accept
start
and
end
points
and
any
other
functionality
supported
such
as
width
color
etc
points
will
be
awarded
based
on
the
sophistication
and
elegance
of
the
functionality
use
of
operating
system
graphics
primitives
for
phase
1
primitives
the
only
operating
system
primitives
you
may
use
are
those
that
draw
individual
pixels
or
clear
the
screen
this
restriction
applies
only
to
the
graphics
code
specified
by
this
assignment
for
the
user
interface
you
may
use
any
operating
system
or
library
support
available
to
make
your
job
easier
for
phase
2
and
later
you
may
use
built
in
operating
system
or
library
primitives
that
draw
lines
circles
polygons
etc
so
that
you
can
concentrate
on
implementing
the
higher
level
functionality
called
for
in
the
assignments
resources
many
of
the
options
can
be
programmed
using
only
information
from
the
text
book
following
each
option
the
page
numbers
in
the
text
book
that
cover
it
are
listed
in
parenthesis
for
some
options
especially
in
phase
4
the
text
book
has
insufficient
detail
to
allow
you
to
program
it
without
using
outside
resources
the
reference
books
cited
should
prove
helpful
and
the
library
has
many
other
graphics
books
that
would
be
helpful
also
important
note
not
all
of
the
graphics
books
are
available
in
the
library
on
the
shelf
some
of
the
graphics
books
are
kept
behind
locked
doors
some
of
them
include
cds
or
disks
and
you
have
to
ask
the
librarian
to
get
them
for
you
before
you
can
check
them
out
feel
free
to
come
in
and
see
the
ta
during
office
hours
for
additional
help
the
programming
assignments
for
this
class
are
heavy
and
the
deadlines
come
up
quickly
it
is
important
to
not
get
stuck
and
procrastinate
working
on
the
assignment
until
the
deadline
is
imminent
if
you
reach
a
point
where
you
are
not
sure
how
to
proceed
it
is
much
better
to
get
some
help
right
away
and
get
going
again
rather
than
wait
until
deadline
panic
sets
in
and
it
may
be
too
late
to
catch
up
