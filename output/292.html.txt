course
description
almost
every
course
in
computer
science
uses
concepts
from
mathematics
it
is
the
aim
of
this
course
to
present
many
of
the
mathematical
topics
that
are
frequently
encountered
while
learning
computer
science
those
who
have
taken
c201
using
scheme
know
the
importance
of
recursion
in
programming
we
start
by
examining
in
more
detail
the
concept
of
recursion
in
chapter
2
entitled
iteration
induction
and
recursion
in
preparation
for
study
in
the
analysis
of
algorithms
we
shall
look
at
the
big
oh
notation
in
chapter
3
throughout
mathematics
we
find
that
graphical
representation
of
ideas
make
them
easier
to
comprehend
the
same
is
true
in
computer
science
and
we
next
go
to
chapter
5
to
discuss
special
graphs
called
trees
as
they
are
used
as
a
data
model
in
computing
sets
are
another
important
mathematical
concept
underlying
much
of
computer
science
and
these
are
treated
in
chapter
7
those
who
work
in
database
theory
know
the
importance
of
the
relational
databases
we
next
study
functions
and
relations
from
a
set
theoretic
point
of
view
chapter
9
presents
a
more
general
discussion
of
graph
theory
than
the
previous
discussion
of
trees
logic
underlies
all
of
computer
science
we
next
cover
propositional
logic
which
makes
up
chapters
12
and
14
of
aho
and
ullman
if
time
permits
in
the
last
part
of
the
course
we
shall
investigate
finite
state
automata
a
way
of
modeling
computation
this
material
is
is
contained
in
chapter
10
if
time
permits
we
shall
also
discuss
turing
machines
and
the
halting
problem
note
that
we
have
skipped
many
of
the
chapters
in
our
text
we
shall
also
skip
over
many
of
the
sections
within
chapters
this
text
is
designed
for
a
year
long
course
which
introduces
students
not
only
to
the
fundamental
ideas
underlying
computer
science
but
also
to
the
important
data
structures
used
in
computing
it
would
be
nice
to
have
enough
time
during
the
semester
to
cover
the
whole
text
but
since
this
is
not
the
case
and
since
the
material
that
we
skip
is
so
interesting
you
might
consider
reading
some
of
the
sections
or
chapters
we
skip
to
get
a
head
start
for
some
of
the
future
courses
homework
assignments
will
be
posted
to
the
class
web
page
regularly
usually
due
the
next
discussion
section
late
assignments
will
not
be
accepted
please
write
your
solutions
to
the
problems
in
a
way
that
will
be
easy
for
the
graders
to
read
and
understand
presentation
of
the
answers
is
a
significant
factor
in
grading
homework
in
this
course
you
may
discuss
assignments
with
other
students
do
not
assume
this
is
true
in
all
your
courses
we
expect
you
to
actually
think
through
and
fully
understand
assignment
solutions
we
have
found
that
students
who
copy
someone
else
s
work
and
turn
in
something
they
do
not
fully
understand
usually
do
poorly
on
the
examinations
which
carry
much
more
weight
in
grading
teamwork
in
doing
assignments
is
good
as
long
as
each
member
of
the
team
contributes
and
fully
understands
the
assignment
if
you
are
working
with
a
group
please
indicate
it
on
your
homework
papers
if
someone
has
given
you
a
lot
of
help
acknowledge
them
you
will
not
be
penalized
and
they
will
get
the
thanks
they
deserve
