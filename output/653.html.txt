systems
programming
and
operating
systems
an
introduction
to
the
logical
design
of
systems
programs
with
emphasis
on
multiprogrammed
operating
systems
topics
include
process
synchronization
deadlock
memory
management
input
output
methods
information
sharing
protection
and
security
and
file
systems
the
impact
of
network
and
distributed
computing
environments
on
operating
systems
is
also
discussed
this
is
a
fast
paced
subject
requiring
constant
attention

prerequsites
complete
familiarity
with
the
material
of
cs314
is
assumed
in
particular
a
knowledge
of
computer
architecture
assembly
programming
language
and
program
structure
is
required
i
ll
cover
some
of
the
introductory
material
in
class
as
required
but
the
purpose
of
that
will
be
to
remind
the
audience
of
the
material
1
2
course
outline
the
course
will
be
organized
roughly
as
follows
i
say
roughly
because
depending
on
the
feedback
from
the
class
i
may
change
the
order
or
the
content
of
particular
sections
we
ll
start
off
with
an
overview
of
concurrency
issues
we
ll
discuss
synchronization
issues
in
particular
ensuring
mutual
exclusion
deadlock
detections
and
prevention
algorithms
we
ll
discuss
multiprocessor
issues
as
well
next
we
ll
go
on
to
memory
management
here
we
ll
discuss
virtual
memory
and
various
methods
used
to
implement
virtual
memory
such
as
paging
and
segmentation
next
we
ll
cover
file
systems
finally
we
ll
look
at
evolution
of
the
traditional
operating
systems
and
look
at
micro
kernels
if
time
permits
we
ll
have
a
few
lectures
on
advanced
topics
such
as
multi
threading
and
serverless
file
systems
