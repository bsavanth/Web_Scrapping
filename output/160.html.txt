welcome
the
laboratory
for
perceptual
robotics
lpr
is
in
the
computer
science
department
here
at
umass
you
can
find
specific

information
the
laboratory
for
perceptual
robotics
research
areas
include
dexterous
manipulation
reaching
and
grasping
mobile
robot
navigation
geometric
reasoning
assembly
planning
and
the
application
of
learning
theory
to
robotics
some
of
the

and
robin
popplestone
and
the
center
for
automated

systems
carts
at
the
university
of
massachusetts
is
focused
on
new
technologies
to
control
robots
in
uncertain
