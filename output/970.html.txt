overview
our
group
is
part
of
the
department
of
computer
sciences
at
univ
texas
at
austin
the
long
term
goal
of
our
research
is
to
develop
technology
for
constructing
and
using
large
multifunctional
knowledge
bases
on
computers
these
knowledge
bases
would
significantly
improve
current
expert
systems
and
tutoring
systems
because
they
contain
the
broad
knowledge
of
a
domain
required
to
perform
multiple
tasks
and
to
explain
domain
knowledge
from
multiple
viewpoints
during
the
past
eight
years
we
have
built
a
large
knowledge
base
in
one
area
of
biology
and
developed
methods
for
automatically
answering
a
variety
of
questions
using
the
knowledge
base
containing
about
180
000
facts
concerning
30
000
concepts
our
knowledge
base
is
one
of
the
largest
of
its
kind
i
e
its
content
is
structured
and
formally
represented
in
addition
to
expanding
this
knowledge
base
we
are
also
beginning
to
construct
similar
knowledge
bases
in
other
domains
most
notably
the
domain
of
distributed
computing
we
are
especially
encouraged
by
the
results
from
using
our
knowledge
base
for
a
variety
of
ai
tasks
most
recently
james
lester
used
the
biology
knowledge
base
to
test
his
system
for
explanation
generation
the
system
generated
about
60
explanations
expressed
in
english
concerning
biological
objects
and
events
in
a
controlled
experiment
domain
experts
found
little
difference
between
these
explanations
and
those
written
by
their
colleagues
currently
we
are
extending
the
types
of
questions
that
can
be
answered
using
automated
reasoning
with
a
large
knowledge
base
jeff
rickel
developed
a
method
for
compositional
modeling
the
task
of
constructing
a
model
appropriate
for
answering
a
prediction
what
if
question
performing
this
task
well
requires
building
the
simplest
model
that
can
adequately
answer
the
question
a
daunting
requirement
since
knowledge
bases
like
ours
implicitly
contain
many
models
at
numerous
levels
of
detail
the
qualitative
process
compiler
and
qsim
are
used
to
simulate
the
models
built
by
jeff
s
program
finally
we
are
testing
the
generality
of
our
research
results
by
building
a
knowledge
base
in
another
domain
distributed
computing
environments
focussing
on
osf
s
dce
to
construct
a
help
desk
assistant
for
automatically
answering
a
proportion
of
customer
s
questions
which
would
otherwise
be
phoned
in
to
a
normal
