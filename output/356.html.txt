vision
research
overview
the
database
environment
for
vision
research
was
designed
as
a
general
scientific
database
system
but
motivated
by
and
intended
for
use
in
model
based
computer
vision
we
provide
a
unified
data
model
a
highly
graphical
user
interface
an
advanced
query
facility
and
an
interactive
laboratory
notebook
the
database
environment
for
vision
research
aids
in
scientific
experimentation
and
promotes
data
sharing
in
the
computer
vision
community
in
devr
entities
are
stored
in
hierarchical
relational
data
structures
the
schema
for
each
entity
contains
a
name
a
set
of
properties
a
set
of
parts
a
set
of
attributed
relations
among
the
parts
and
a
set
of
graphic
definitions
which
describe
how
to
build
instance
specific
visualizations
we
are
studying
