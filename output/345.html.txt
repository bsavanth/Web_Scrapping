the
flux
project
s
objectives
are
i
to
provide
infrastructure
the
flux
for
highly
efficient
component
based
systems
with
flexible
degrees
of
inter
component
trust
initially
oriented
to
hardware
enforced
protection
ii
to
provide
transparent
and
flexible
control
of
all
the
resources
used
by
arbitrary
subsystems
and
iii
to
distribute
free
and
usable
versions
of
the
developed
software
we
have
recently
developed
an
entirely
new
kernel
and
os
structure
on
which
future
work
will
be
based
a
new
paper
microkernels
meet
recursive
virtual
machines
describes
how
this
system
efficiently
supports
recursive
virtual
machines
that
paper
as
well
as
a
paper
on
cpu
inheritance
scheduling
appeared
at

the
draft
api
for
fluke
the
new
kernel
is
available
in
html
format

and
2

postscript
beware
it
s
currently
110
pages
long
but
mostly
white
space
a
design
and
rationale
document
will
be
forthcoming
later
this
year
one
of
the
design
features
which
should
provide
large
performance
gains
is
safely
storing
portions
of
normal
kernel
objects
in
user
space
as
outlined
in
these
slides
from
a
work
in
progress
talk
at
