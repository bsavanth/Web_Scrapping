laboratory
for
molecular
robotics
molecular
robotics
is
an
emerging
and
highly
interdisciplinary
field
that
seeks
to
produce
new
materials
and
devices
at
a
nanometer
scale
by
direct
interaction
with
atomic
structures
whereas
conventional
chemistry
relies
on
bulk
phenomena
such
as
diffusion
to
create
self
assembling
structures
molecular
robotics
manipulates
structures
by
applying
external
forces
and
precisely
positioning
atoms
and
molecules
it
is
a
revolutionary
technology
which
attempts
to
provide
fine
control
over
the
structure
of
matter
analogous
to
the
fine
control
we
can
now
exert
upon
the
bits
and
bytes
of
information
structures
future
applications
range
from
very
fast
and
small
computers
to
nanorobots
and
self
replicating
machines
nanorobots
might
be
programmed
to
recognize
and
repair
specific
kinds
of
cells
and
to
perform
a
large
variety
of
other
tasks
that
are
now
impossible
to
accomplish
large
structures
might
be
built
by
using
massive
parallelism
the
technology
has
the
potential
for
major
scientific
and
practical
breakthroughs
however
today
we
lack
most
of
the
tools
necessary
for
realizing
the
dreams
of
molecular
robotics
research
opportunities
abound
