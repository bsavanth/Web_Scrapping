a
skip
list
is
constructed
as
follows
every
element
has
a
pointer
at
level
0
which
connects
all
of
them
into
a
sorted

list
for
each

some

i

have

i
pointers
which
connect
them
into
a
sorted

list
the
structure
is
constructed
as
follows
suppose
you
re
given
such
a
list
to
insert
the
next
element
x
into
the
list
search
for
where
it
goes
in
the

list
and
splice
it
in
then

a

list
has

and

inserting
or
finding
an
element
in
a
data
structure
constructed
in
this
way
requires
o

time
suppose
that
you
have
access
to
a
biased
coin
with
unknown
bias
althogh
probability
of
heads
is
strictly
between
0
and
1
show
how
to
use
this
coin
to
simulate
a
fair
coin
suppose
that
i
give
you
a
piece
of
paper
with
n
lines
drawn
across
its
surface
they
re
arbitrarily
oriented
and
each
goes
from
edge
to
edge
there
s
a
dot
drawn
somewhere
on
the
paper
representing
the
origin
you
repeat
the
following
choose
one
of
the
remaining
lines
at
random
and
cut
the
paper
along
it
then
hold
onto
the
piece
that
has
the
dot
origin
and
throw
the
rest
away
repeat
this
until
all
lines
have
been
cut
so
you
re
left
with
the
smallest
convex
region
containing
the
origin
that
is
bounded
by
the
given
line
segments
fact
throughout
this
process
the
total
number
of
times
that
you
cut
across
any
of
the
remaining
lines
is
expected
to
be
o
n
ln
n
use
this
fact
to
design
an
algorithm
which
given
n
half
planes
each
containing
the
origin
computes
their
intersection
in
expected
time
o
n
lg
n
by
incrementally
adding
one
half
plane
at
a
time
recall
the
description
of
treaps
given
in
class
briefly
every
element
has
a
key
and
a
priority
they
are
put
into
a
binary
tree
such
that
they
have
an
inorder
ordering
binary
search
tree
property
with
respect
to
keys
and
a
heap
ordering
with
respect
to
priorities
a
random
treap
is
one
where
the
priorities
have
been
assigned
randomly
for
this
problem
we
ll
just
assume
that
the
prioirities
are
given
by
some
random
permutation
let
x
be
any
element
and
a
the
set
of
ancestors
of
x
in
the
random
treap
let
x
be
the
length
of
the
path
from
the
root
to
x
then
x
keys
x
and
in
a
keys
x
and
in
a
use
this
obvious
fact
to
give
a
precise
value
for
the
expected
depth
of
x
when
x
is
the
m
th
largest
element
in
the
tree
i
e
solve
for
the
leading
constants
as
well
you
can
tack
on
a
o
1
at
the
end
if
you
d
like
recall
that
to
insert
an
element
you
proceed
as
in
a
binary
search
tree
then
attach
a
random
priority
and
rotate
up
the
tree
until
heap
ordering
has
been
restored
argue
that
the
expected
number
of
rotations
on
an
insertion
is
2
deletion
in
a
treap
is
handled
in
a
rather
odd
way
to
delete
x
rotate
it
down
the
tree
until
it
is
a
leaf
and
remove
it
describe
this
procedure
in
more
detail
then
show
that
the
expected
number
of
rotations
is
