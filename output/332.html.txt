space
is
an
approach
to
operating
systems
which
uses
multiple
protection
domains
rather
than
a
single
kernel
to
provide
operating
system
services
eliminating
the
monolithic
kernel
allows
the
operating
system
to
be
written
as
a
set
of
cooperating
application
programs
this
has
a
great
impact
on
the
extensibility
and
flexibility
of
the
system
multiple
instances
of
fundamental
paradigms
such
as
threads
and
virtual
memory
can
coexist
since
they
are
implemented
as
applications
code
all
that
is
left
in
what
was
the
operating
system
kernel
is
a
set
of
mechanisms
to
implement
the
protection
domains
in
space
these
mechanisms
can
be
replaced
as
needed
by
the
application
to
provide
a
fundamental
level
of
extensibility
not
available
in
other
adaptive
operating
systems
