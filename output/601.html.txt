relevant

relevant
predication
description
this
research
program
attempts
to
give
a
formal
theory
of
predication
within
the
context
of
relevance
logic
for
an
implication
to
be
relevant
there
must
be
some
connection
between
its
antecedent
and
consequent
correspondingly
in
order
for
a
predication
to
be
relevant
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
predicate
and
the
term
of
which
it
is
predicated
this
project
in
philosophical
logic
has
a
link
to
the
computer
science
notion
of
a
strict
function
one
that
depends
on
its
arguments
a
definition
of
relevant
predication
can
be
given
within
relevance
logic
with
identity
and
its
formal
properties
are
being
explored
and
linked
with
various
ontological
issues
concerning
predication
this
include
vacuous
predication
external
relations
the
question
of
whether
existence
is
a
property
and
whether
membership
and
exemplification
are
relations
there
are
also
applications
to
the
philosophy
of
science
in
connection
with
the
goodman
grue
bleen
paradox
and
other
paradoxes
of
confirmation
applications
have
also
been
made
to
the
frame
problem
in
ai
and
by
raymundo
morado
to
non
monotonic
reasoning
treating
relevant
predication
as
default
predication
