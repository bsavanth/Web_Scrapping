under

research
the
current
focus
is
on
processing
of
bi
level
images
such
as
text
pages
and
bar
codes
theoretically
the
pixels
of
such
images
can
have
only
two
possible
values
the
practical
situation
is
quite
different
the
optical
system
of
the
scanner
causes
blurring
illumination
may
be
uneven
and
so
forth
as
a
result
the
scanned
images
contain
a
range
of
values
simple
techniques
such
as
thresholding
have
serious
limitations
the
laboratory
has
pioneered
techniques
that
allow
the
recovery
of
the
ideal
image
even
when
blurring
and
other
distortions
are
severe

we
have
resumed
work
in
the
area
of
interactive

and
particularly
in
problems
where
