daisy
dsi
programming
system
description
dsi
is
an
system
for
symbolic
multiprocessing
based
on
the
underlying
operational
model
of
suspending
construction
the
fundamental
synchronization
mechanism
in
this
model
is
the
suspension
a
transparent
object
representing
a
computation
suspensions
evolve
into
manifest
data
values
which
can
be
inspected
and
manipulated
by
other
computations
computation
is
demand
oriented
a
relaxation
of
demand
driven
computation
in
which
a
system
with
available
processing
resources
can
speculatively
activate
suspensions
for
bounded
execution
we
are
interested
in
this
model
as
a
general
basis
for
improving
the
performance
of
limited
scale
multiprocessors
daisy
is
a
surface
language
for
programming
in
the
dsi
system
daisy
is
an
applicative
language
a
mutation
of
scheme
with
provisions
for
exploiting
a
suspending
list
constructor
among
these
provisions
are
constructs
for
building
networks
of
streams
including
windowing
operations
for
stream
based
i
o
these
facilities
make
daisy
a
good
language
for
modeling
networks
of
self
timed
communicating
processes
