supercomputing
technologies
or
supertech
is
a
vertically
integrated
alliance
of
several
lcs
groups
supertech
s
goal
is
to
master
all
aspects
of
high
performance
computing
including
parallel
and
distributed
processing
so
that
modern
hardware
technology
can
be
translated
into
efficient
easy
to
use
computing
systems
organized
as
a
cross
section
of
lcs
supertech
represents
a
cooperative
effort
designed
to
address
the
problems
of
multiscale
computing
to
achieve
our
mission
we
are
studying
machine
architecture
language
design
parallel
computing
theory
numerical
analysis
operating
system
design
and
computational
science
facilities
include
a
128
node
connection
machine
cm

parallel
supercomputer
several
silicon
graphics
high
performance
graphics
workstations
and
networks
of
workstations
supertech
is
driven
in
part
by
the
fact
that
today
s
computer
architect
can
select
from
a
range
of
technology
options
including
cost
performance
reliability
and
power
the
variety
of
options
will
grow
even
larger
within
the
next
decade
with
the
introduction
of
gigabit
networks
lightweight
batteries
multichip
modules
and
optical
switches
as
a
result
we
will
soon
see
a
diverse
set
of
multiscale
computing
environments
including
wireless
computers
high
performance
pcs
multiprocessor
workstations
clusters
of
distributed
workstations
local
area
supercomputers
and
massively
parallel
supercomputers
that
cover
a
wide
range
of
performance
parameters
this
vision
of
multiscale
computing
unfortunately
conflicts
with
an
even
more
powerful
force
software
inertia
existing
software
systems
threaten
multiscale
computing
since
they
sanction
only
a
few
well
established
computing
environments
each
new
environment
will
require
massive
custom
programming
to
retrofit
the
standard
software
in
its
attempts
to
unify
multiscale
computing
as
users
will
surely
demand
through
common
languages
operating
systems
network
protocols
and
applications
we
cope
with
these
limitations
via
common
architectural
and
software
mechanisms
designed
to
unify
the
diverse
multiscale
computing
environments
and
encourage
niche
markets
to
flourish
this
task
requires
hardware
and
software
design
the
formulation
of
theoretical
foundations
and
applications
development
supertech
cooperates
closely
with
project
scout
an
lcs
led
consortium
designed
to
promote
interaction
between
computer
and
computational
scientists
scout
members
include
interdisciplinary
scientists
from
mit
boston
university
and
harvard
mit
participants
include
scientists
engineers
and
mathematicians
from
the
departments
of
physics
electrical
engineering
and
computer
science
mathematics
and
earth
ocean
and
atmospheric
sciences
it
is
under
scout
s
auspices
that
supertech
hosts
such
facilities
as
the
