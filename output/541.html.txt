is
located
at

are
active
at

they
are

such
as

a
number
of
projects
involving
high

imaging
applications
these
include
parallel

in

for

and
symmetric
multiprocessors
we
have
a

of
potential

projects
maintained
by
justin
miller
most
of
our
work
has
been
done
under
unix
but
we
are
currently
considering
a
move
to
windowsnt
there
is
a
discussion
of
some
of
the
issues
here
we
are
hopeful
that
this
move
will
be
supported
by
microsoft
selected
publications
the
following
is
a
list
of
selected
papers
of
research
done
at
the
csrvl
many
of
these
papers
are
available
via
anonymous
