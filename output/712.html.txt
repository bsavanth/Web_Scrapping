the
activities
of
the
faculty
involved
in
digitial
hardware
design
range
from
practical
to
theoretical
with
most
of
our
activity
falling
into
two
broad
areas
the
design
and
implementation
of
novel
computer
architectures
and
the
development
of
algorithms
for
computer
aided
design
and
design
automation
the
computer
architecture
research
also
provides
a
framework
for
device
and
circuit
design
design
for
testability
and
software
tools
for
design
and
implementation
of
very
large
scale
integrated
circuits
the
research
in
computer
aided
design
and
design
automation
explores
the
problems
of
high
level
synthesis
and
scheduling
using
both
formal
representations
and
heuristics
with
emphasis
on
provable
performance
correctness
and
optimal
design
