groups
problems
into
classes
according
to
how
much
of
particular
computational
resources
their
solutions
require
familiar
examples
are
p
and
np
which
are
classes
of
problems
solvable
with
at
most
polynomial
time
with
and
without
nondeterminism
we
will
investigate
what
is
known
about
common
complexity
classes
which
capture
such
ideas
as
feasibility
randomized
algorithms
boolean
circuits
parallel
computation
and
interactive
proofs
along
the
way
we
will
learn
some
of
the
major
recent
results
in
this
area
some
of
which
were
even
reported
in

objectives
to
understand
the
approach
toward
classifying
computational
problems
taken
by
structural
complexity
define
a
class
of
problems
according
to
computational
resources
required
to
solve
them
and
investigate
the
relationships
between
these
classes
to
understand
the
proof
techniques
used
to
characterize
the
inherent
complexity
of
problems
in
this
way
to
be
familiar
with
significant
recent
results
in
computational
complexity
theory
to
gain
experience

of

note
there
will
be
no

but
students
are
strongly
advised
to
work
through
exercises
at
the
end

take
mid

examination
give
an

final
grades
will
be
determined
with
approximately
equal
weights
on
