the
agassiz
project
the
primary
goals
of
the
agassiz
project
are
to
study
the
architectural
compiler
and
machine
organizational
issues
for
high
performance
computer
systems
including
both
uniprocessors
and
multiprocessors
that
exploit
medium
grained
and
fine
grained
parallelism
processor
architectural
studies
are
focused
on
concurrent
multi
threaded
architectures
that
allow
both
thread
level
and
instruction
level
speculation
or
so
called
superthreaded
architectures
the
compiler
effort
is
focused
on
developing
an
integrated
compiler
that
supports
both
medium
grained
loop
iteration
level
and
fine
grained
instruction
level
parallelism
with
speculation
locality
enhancement
and
latency
hiding
schemes
the
machine
organizational
work
is
focused
on
high
performance
memory
systems
design
and
on
clustered
distributed
shared
memory
multiprocessors
