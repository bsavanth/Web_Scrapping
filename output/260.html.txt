blurb
there
are
many
approaches
to
formal
reasoning
the
objective
of
specifying
computer
programs
including
the
formalization
of
worlds
with
which
programs
are
to
interact
has
led
to
the
creation
of
numerous
tools
for
formal
reasoning
we
will
examine
some
systems
for
formal
reasoning
while
examining
a
number
of
mechanical
formal
methods
tools
that
support
these
different
systems
examples
of
such
system
tool
pairs
are

recursive

students
will
choose
with
the
help
of
the
instructor
a
system
and
or
tool
to
examine
and
the
grade
will
be
based
upon
presentations
about
these

and

on
either

many
of
these
systems
have
good
freely

implementations

making
a
