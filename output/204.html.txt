perusing

friday
november
29
is
treated
as
class
day
project
in
this
course
we
will
not
only
talk
about
operating
systems
we
will
actually
build
one
while
doing
this
you
will
realize
that
writing
os
code
is
to
programming
your
typical
application
like
nascar
racing
to
driving
your
mom
in
law
to
sunday
brunch
if
you
don
t
like
the
smell
of
burning
tires
forget
it
if
you
need
somebody
to
hold
you
by
the
hand
like
memory
protection
you
are
in
really
bad
shape
fortunately
for
you
most
of
the
machines
here
are
used
by
real
people
trying
to
get
real
work
done
they
and
the
system
support
staff
would
resent
it
heavily
if
we
started
tinkering
with
the
operating
system
on
some
of
the
machines
in
this
semester
we
will
therefore
be
playing
with
and
improve
upon
a
simulated
operating
system
the
simulation
is
rather
sophisticated
and
simulates
the
system
to
quite
some
detail
the
implementation
of
that
system
is
such
that
you
should
be
able
to
concentrate
on
the
os
issues
and
not
have
to
worry
about
the
simulation
nevertheless
you
will
be
exposed
to
quite
some
tricky
situations
which
will
foster
your
understanding
of
what
is
or
at
least
what
should
be
going
on
in
an
os
the
environment
for
the
projects
is
written
in
c
which
gives
a
nice
opportunity
to
some
of
you
to
get
a
little
experience
in
writing
simple
object
oriented
code
simple
i
nbsp
mean
from
an
object
oriented
standpoint
the
code
itself
will
be
rather
sophisticated
for
the
students
who
are
not
familiar
with
c
a
short
introduction
of
the
most
important
concepts
will
be
given
in
class
a
working
knowledge
of
c
will
be
assumed
these
pages
are
prone
to
change
without
notice
consult
them
regularly
to
avoid
surprises
