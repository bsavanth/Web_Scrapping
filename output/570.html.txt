calvin
i
like
to
verb
words
hobbes
what
calvin
i
take
nouns
and
adjectives
and
use
them
as
verbs
remember
when
access
was
a
thing
now
it
s

you
do
it

maybe
we
can
eventually
make

information
extraction
our
natural
language
processing
research
focuses
on
information
extraction
which
involves
recognizing
and
extracting
specific
types
of
information
from
text
we
are
currently
building
a
new
conceptual
sentence
analyzer
called
sundance
sentence
understanding
and
concept
extraction
automated
dictionary
construction
we
have
developed
the
autoslog
dictionary
construction
system
that
generates
dictionaries
of
extraction
patterns
automatically
using
an
annotated
corpus
we
are
currently
working
with
a
new
version
autoslog
ts
that
does
not
require
text
annotations
but
simply
preclassified
texts
instead
text
categorization
our
approach
to
text
classification
an
underlying
information
extraction
system
to
recognize
linguisic
context
in
order
to
achieve
high
precision
we
have
developed
several
algorithms
for
text
classification
including
the
relevancy
signatures
algorithm
the
augmented
relevency
signatures
algorithm
and
a
case
based
classification
algorithm
information
retrieval
the
ursa
utah
retrieval
system
architecture
project
has
been
ongoing
at
utah
for
many
years
and
involves
building
query
based
retrieval
engines
