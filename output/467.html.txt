among
the

group
s
research
is
a
project
called
numesh
which
effectively
combines
tinkertoy
modularity
with
supercomputer
performance
numesh
describes
a
packaging
and
interconnect
technology
that
supports
high
bandwidth
systolic
communications
on
a
novel

four

nearest
neighbor
lattice
numesh
modules
simply
plug
together
rather
than
being
connected
by
printed
circuit
traces
or
backplane
buses
numesh
explores
an
engineering
discipline
in
which
physical
location
of
components
are
accounted
for
explicitly
rather
than
being
abstracted
out
of
the
logical
model
simple
engineering
models
are
provided
via
software
tools
instead
of
hardware
generality
much
as
risc
maintains
its
programming
model
through
compilation
rather
than
through
processor
complexity
modularity
of
the
communications
substrate
provides
regularity
in
the
compilation
target
and
allows
iteration
of
a
single
communication
building
block
to
replace
a
variety
of
ad
hoc
communication
paths

associate
the
cost
performance
advantages
of
this
approach
stem
from
three
factors
first
physical
component
placement
is
optimized
as
part
of
the
logical
design
secondly
the
underlying
communication
technology
can
be
designed
for
performance
rather
than
interconnect
flexibility
and
thirdly
interconnection
relies
on
mass
produced
modules
not
on
configuration
specific
wiring
numesh
research
embraces
several
technologies
including
architecture
of
the
communications
substrate
clocking
and
communication
technologies
compilers
and
programming
models
and
representative
applications
our
initial
focus
has
been
the
important
class
of
algorithms
whose
static
communication
patterns
can
be
precompiled
into
a
system
of
independent
but
carefully
choreographed
finite
state
machine
descriptions
we
also
are
exploring
the
extension
of
numesh
to
more
general
communication
to
support
dynamic
routing
for
example
on
another
front
the
alewife
project
was
created
to
design
a
scalable
cache
coherent
shared
memory
multiprocessor
in
this
program
several
thousand
vlsi
processors
each
associated
with
a
portion
of
shared
memory
are
interconnected
via
a
multistage
network
unlike
conventional
shared
memory
machines
this
multiprocessor
exploits
locality
of
referencing
at
the
hardware
and
software
levels
to
maximize
available
memory
bandwidth
a
new
distributed
directory
ensures
coherence
of
the
high
speed
caches
each
processor
uses
to
store
both
private
and
shared
data
thus
further
utilizing
locality
research
focuses
on
data
collection
methods
analytical
and
simulation
techniques
for
evaluating
large
scale
parallel
computers
and
designing
and
building
new
interconnection
networks
and
processor
cache
memory
systems
an
important
goal
is
to
couple
the
design
of
algorithms
for
compilers
and
operating
systems
to
their
goal
resultant
impact
on
multiprocessor
performance
address
traces
obtained
using
various
data
collection
techniques
help
evaluate
architectural
choices
this
insight
in
turn
feeds
back
to
software
development
a
major
part
of
the
project
investigates
hardware
technologies
and
packaging
for
future
high
density
low
latency
interconnections
